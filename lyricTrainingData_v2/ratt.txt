Wanted man
Well, low dealer, with snake eyes
You cross me, you realize you're-
You're hot leather, you're cold steel
You make a move, I'll make you feel like a
Human target, in my eyes
I've got you, well, in my sights
And by the rope, you will hang
It's your neck, from this Ratt gang
'Cause I'm a wanted man
'Cause I'm a, a wanted man
Well, gun fighter, you think twice
Are you fast, you heed my advice
I drink whiskey, you say goodnight
I'll put an end, to this here fight you're a
Human target, In my eyes
I've got you, well in my sights
It's really what you wanna be
A wanted man (a wanted man) [repeat]
'Cause I'm a, a wanted man, yes I am
'Cause I'm a, a wanted man [repeat]

Oh yeah
Well, fast as lightnin', and the gun
Your shadow's got you on the run
You're such a fighter, I said you're the one
And I will only tell you once
You're in trouble, what are you gonna do
You're in trouble, it's what you're goin' through, goin' through
You're such a teaser, you give me life
I live in jungles and live with knives
There's always trouble on your mind
And won't you make me draw the line
And that's the price you pay to lie
You wanted trouble, you tell me why
We're gonna get you, what ya gonna do, do, do
We're gonna get you, what ya gonna do
Yeah!
You're on the top, top, the top, well, top of the night
Hey hey, hey hey, hey hey
You're in trouble, well, trouble, I got a finger on you
You're in trouble, It's what you're goin' through
You're in trouble

Out on the streets, that's where we'll meet
You make the night, I always cross the line
Tightened our belts, abused ourselves
Get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf
Another day, some other way
We're gonna go, but then we'll see you again
I've had enough, we've had enough
Cold in vain, she said
I knew right from the beginning
That you would end up winnin'
I knew right from the start
You'd put an arrow through my heart
Round and round
With love we'll find a way just give it time
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why
Dig!
Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
The way you move, you know it's easy to see
The neon light's on me tonight
I've got a way, we're gonna prove it tonight
Like Romeo to Juliet
Time and time, I'm gonna make you mine
It's all the same, she said
Yeah!
With love we'll find a way just give it time, time, time, time
I'll tell you why, why, why, why

Well, I saw the time closin' in, you said you're leavin' me
I'm cursed with your heart's perfection
Well, said it's right to believe
Well, months and days, they slowly pass
I'm not waitin' for you
You turned me 'round in your direction
I'm lookin' for you, yeah
You spin me your way, in your direction
You pull me your way, in your direction
Well, city lights are shinin' on me
Well, said it's time to go
Abusin' you all across the country
Said I feel hot coals, yeah

Too many problems, the world can't solve
Too many people, no-one wants to be involved
(Lack of communication, back off)
Keep rearranging, it's all the same
Always saying, someone else is to blame
Look all around me, who's standin' tall
Hold tight, no-one's gonna answer your call
Put up our boundaries, we build our walls
It's alright, no-one's gonna change us at all
Time's passin' us by, we have our reason
No-one wants to try, we have our reason
Questions askin' why, we have our reason
Problems still arise, we have our reason... for
Back off!
You're so together, you fall apart
You never miss, when you're shootin' straight for the heart
You see it your way, I'll see it mine
Well, conversation is a useless change of line
Lack of communication
Well, back off, well, back off
In the age of the modern man
We see the problems, we don't really understand
Well, lack of communication
Back off, well, back off...
(Lack of communication, back off) [repeat]

You turn him away, you tell him you're mine
You make him believe you're but one of a kind
You give him a cold look, you tell him a lie
You turn him away, girl, you know you're mine
And you're back, you're back for more
You turn away, you're back for more
You gave him an inch, he took you a mile
He made you believe you're society's child
Then get in his new car, get in his style
I told you his way, he won't take you far

You think unkindly, simple not sane, know what I mean
Say I'm deliberately sent here to please
It's what you need, so I'm here tonight
You won't confuse me with somebody else
Look in your mirror, you're too good for yourself
It's all in your books, your magazines, can't you see
I'll be headin' out in time, if it's wrong or right
I'll leave the morning after [repeat]
Say I'm in to somebody else, know what I mean
I know you'll always think one of my kind
You're on my mind, baby, all the time
Lift your skirt, lady, high in the night
I'm just what you need, won't you give it a try
Don't put up a fight, it's gonna be alright, can't you see
Stay by my...
Solo
It's gonna be right, right out of the night
When out of the night, now, it's gonna be right
When out of the night, can't you see
I'll leave the morning, morning, morning,
morning, morning, on and on

Well, I'm off my rocker, I fell out of my tree
I've been standin' on shaky ground
There's no helping me, yeah
I can't remember my number
I can't remember your name
I can't remember all the trouble I'm in, child
Well, I'm insane [repeat]
You don't go looking for trouble
Well, I'm all the trouble you need
You don't go looking for bad love
You got it guaranteed, yeah
I can't see no colors
I can't play your games
I should've listened what my momma said, child
I'm insane [repeat]
You lock me up in a padded room
Chain me to the floor
Well, I'm headed for lobotomy
And I'm beggin' them for more
Well, I'm off my rocker, I fell outta my tree
Well, there's no helping me, yeah

I wanna rock, but you, you dared to roll
I came by your house, but you, you weren't at home
Well, I knock on your door, I hear you beg for more
You broke the law you see, and that's a felony
I think you've been caught (You have been caught)
At the scene of the crime (You have been caught)
At the scene of the...
Now I know what you've done to me
At the scene of the crime
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
I've got me a weapon, got me a loaded gun
You know I'll track you down
And you'll be on the run, no fun
You broke the law in the first degree
Now I know what you thought of me
Well, I know, well, you know, well, I know
Well, I know, well, your games
And I don't wanna play
Well, now I know what you thought of me
You've been out, and I've been cheated
Well, I've been lied to, again and again, again and again
(You have been caught) At the scene of the crime, yeah
(You have been caught) At the scene of the...

You take the midnight subway train
You're callin' all the shots
You're struck by lightning
You're in love
You take the evening one on one
You're only livin' to have fun
You want to use me, take me home tonight
I'll make you wish that you were mine
It's not worth fighting
Well turn around
Remember me
I'm the one
Who's out and aimed to please
You make your livin' lovin' hot
You spin me like a top
You take the evening one on one (On one)
You're in love (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well turn around (Turn around)
Remember me (Remember me)
(You take the midnight subway train)
(You're callin' all the shots)
(You take the evening one on one)
(You're only livin' to have fun)
(It's not worth fighting)

Hey!
I'm gonna make my statement
Don't need arrangements
I said you're not gonna make tracks
All over my life
When push comes to shove I'll be pushin' you down
Better think twice when you take that step
That you got both feet on the ground
Never use love (Never use love)
I don't want to fight
I won't get in your way
Don't give me the right
Never use love
I've gotta find my place
Don't need no replacements
When you think you're too much
Then I've had enough, hell yeah!

I know you don't really know me
I know you don't really care to see me
I'm into total affection
Not being scared if you never please me
You know you really want to lay it down
Right now
And how
I know you really want to lay it down
Lay it down
Under the sheets you will find me
I know that nothin's for free
You take what's good for your pleasin'
I'll take what's good for this crazy evening
"And I know you only want romance."
"I'll give you all that I can."
If you give me just one chance
To prove myself
In love
Yeah yeah yeah

Taken away on a ride not far from here
Well no wastin' time, she's got plans for me
She came behind and then showed me her thighs
You know what I mean
Well no way to say she could win the likes of me
The life of me
She said, "I'd like to wear you out
And give it all to you
I'll find a reason now
Just give it all, just give it all"
I want to give you all my love tonight (Give it all)
Just give a sign to me, I'll make it right (Give it all)
A fashion plate in a way, she really was
She had style and class understand she'll pay to dance
She moved my soul, don't you know she's here to please
Well I'm on my knees, can't you see, move in on me
Move in on me
Give it all (Give it all)
I said give it all (Give it all)
Hey!
(Give it all)

Ah!
I listen to you, are you listening to me
The way that you are, it's easy to see
Feelings for you, now I feel free
I'm lost in time
It's not the way that you hold me
It's not that I really care
It's not to say that to love is to own me
You're tangled up in my lair
You broke your promises
Fallen out of love
When you cross the line
You're one step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
One step closer to my heart
Indecision, it's all been heard
No more confusion, the page has turned
Still with the darkness of the night
I always see the light
When you cross the line, then you'll find
That you're one step closer to my heart
(One step) Closer to my heart

I don't like your cheatin' misfit way
I don't stand for givin' it away
So you want some action, ask me why
You say you want to keep me in your target sight
Can't you see the world turn and hear the cries?
Can't you see you're burnin' me right between the eyes?
I don't like your hot and cold device
You know I'm the only one this time
Can't you see you're burnin' me between the eyes?
You hardly notice
I see you burnin' me between the eyes
I don't like your cheatin' misfit ways
Right between the eyes
(Between the eyes)

I make my moves
I make them right
I don't refuse
I keep it light
I take command
Of the scene
Because for me
There's no in-betweens
I keep holdin' on
Holdin' on through the night
'Cause it's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get
It's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)
I take my time
And I don't care
This love ain't right
What's fair is fair
If you just ask
You will receive
Give me the task
I aim to please
It's so easy, yeah
What you give is what you get (What you get is what you get)

"Hello?"
Well cocktails for two, me and you
It's some fun hot afternoon
Whenever I'm alone
I sit and pick up the phone, give a call
She's so hot to have and to hold me
She said "I'll be your one and only"
I know what it means to be alone
Got me on the line
Ready for the night
You got me on the line
Now you'll think twice
You like your home sweet home all alone
You will be callin' me
I've heard the news around the town
You're not gonna hang up on me
Long distance kept me holding on
Long distance kept me holdin' on
Ready for tonight, tonight, tonight (Tonight)
Hey!
"Nobody hangs up on me."

My blood is thicker than water
I'm livin' out my life
I'll have my friends forever
We'll walk the sands of time
You should know by now
I never take no chances
Don't stand for compromise
I'll find the hidden treasure
I'm only passin' by
Can you hear me tellin' you (Tellin' you)
I've got something to say (Hey)
Don't you know it's nothin' new
Don't you get in my way, get in my way

Dangerous
But worth the risk
The things you do
To get your fix
You'll head for fun
You're on my list
Live for love
Will get you this
I know something, you know that it's true
I can feel it when I'm next to you
Dangerous but worth the risk
Your life's not threatened, but your lovin' is
The pressure's on
You're on the run
You're gettin' loose
You're havin' fun
Streets are cold
But remember this
We are dangerous
I know it's true
I know it's you
It's you
It's true
