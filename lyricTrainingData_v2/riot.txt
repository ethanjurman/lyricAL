A streak of lightning is shooting through the air
Electric sun lights the sky
His face is frightening, so evil ones beware
Men of disaster hear his cry
And now at last we know he's real
The power of his sword we feel
Thundersteel Thundersteel
The earth it rumbles, death is in the air
The city crumbles, death is everywhere
And from the burning sky we see the soldier fly
He mounts his horse of steel and now he rides
The power of his word we feel
Men of disaster hexar his cry
Thundersteel Thundersteel Thundersteel

Ride out
The king he proclaimed 'cross the land
Tonight we strike against the enemy to capture their flag
Cry out
The tears that they shed for their brave
Tonight they ride with will, intend to kill who stand in their way
Across the fields
They march
Their task must be done
But in the end they know that this war must be won
Fight or fall
In the name of the children
In the name of us all
We can never surrender
In the night we stand tall
Rise up
Your swords for the souls you must save
Flashing of steel as your blades send them to their grave
Ride proud from the battle where many have died
And when the last is slain its into the distance we ride
We march
Our task must be done
But in the end we know that this war must be won

Oh god what have I done ?
In the shadows on the dark side
Neath the skies of crimson doom
In the streets I hear the wind cry
Evil sings the devil's tune
On your knees and pray for mercy
Let god hear us on this day
Or in the acid rain our bones will lay
Oh cry cry for a world that's torn
Cry for a child unborn
For it's the sign of the crimson storm
Desperate people in the city
Foolish games of greed and wealth
On themselves they have no pity
They are victims of themselves
Gotta make you pay for mercy
Oh cry, cry for a world that's torn
Oh god what have I done?

Thundering down, from the mountain you ride
Clutching a sword made of steel
The ones you call friends, they all left you for dead
Alone on the battlefield
Many were at your command
Renegade souls on the run
Holding each life in your hand
Living for all and for one
Shining, into the night you are riding
Through the darkness and light you are flying
With the wind in your hair
The flight of the warrior
Drunk with revenge from which on one can hide
Into their midst you will run
A face from the grave is the last thing they'll see
And die with your name on their tongues

I hear the call when the sirens scream
Into the night where an angel waits for me
She's lookin' bad she's a killer machine
I say the word and she explodes into light
Blinding power and rage
Players run to the stage
Screaming wings fill the silvery sky
Rising on pillers of flame
And we ride thundering into the sky
And we ride
On wings of eagles we fly
Full alert she is hot for the game
I sense my enemy and fire is the warning I send
A dance of death swirling miles above the rain
While mortals sleep angels swear to defend
I salute you my friend
Unafraid to the end
Devil take the high most
To hell with the rest
Now let the battle begin
Come on get up get out...
Heat seekers flash headed straight for your heart
One finds the mark and a fireball rocks the clouds
Men and machines sweet and deadly we are
We rule the wind on titanium wings
Plunging back from the chase
One more champion erased
I am the last and the plaster of my art
Until I am challenged again
Come on get up get out

What's the use of moving on
Maybe here's where I belong
I've had my fill of life's uncertainties
You think too much they say you're strange
They even raised the drinking age
This place has gone to hell since I've been away
But now this time I'll do it right
Yeah let's start tonight
Make the call and see who's still around
Don't look now, but Johnny's back again
I am your man
I paid the price, I'll take that slide again
Nothing stays the same
Tell the boys to step aside
Tell the girls to form a line
The king is back to claim the land again
Wanna fight? Let's get it done
Need to love, I am the one
Time to remember how we played the game
But now this time we'll do it right
Yeah let's go tonight
What the hell you've got to lose?!
Tell the boys to jump inside
Tonight we're gonna ride
It's time to show'em how its really done
You ever play - you never win
You don't even know what's happening
Until the end and then your race has run
This time we'll do it right

I was born on these streets years ago
I was the king of the neighbourhood
Fast on my feet, I was elite
I was the star of the show
This task must be done - I will not run
I will not lay me down to die
This war I will win, so let it begin
Deep in my heart is a burning fire...
I can't let it go
Alone in the night I know I must fight for my home
Time has changed the seasons
And I will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away
These streets are getting colder
And I am growing older
Tomorrow seems so far away
What's become of us friend, we were one till the end
Now I'm alone in the streetlight gleam
This town knew our names, but nothing's the same
The places I played have forgotten the dream

Whoever lives behind these walls got an appetite for pleasure
I've seen the trail that was left behind for broken hearts and buried treasure, arms and legs, hungry lips, and a grip of steel
One kiss and you live forever; that's one love you never wanna feel
Who's sorry now?
Should never go unknown
You made the choice, but you should've known
Run for your life
Run for your life, you've got to run
Nothing's gonna save you now
From the arms that cling and the jaws that bite
You've got to run for your life, from the kiss of death
Whatever walks behind these doors gonna eat you up alive
You want to run, but you can't resist; you know this lady's never satisfied
She's ready, ready for you with the ? to take you higher
One kiss, and you're defenceless; one bite, and your heart's on fire
Yeah, the thing wanna take you home tonight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

I awoke in the darkness
A ringing in my ears
In the cold and the silence
Feels like I've slept for years
Voices in the distance
Someone speaks my name
The sound of tears and laughter
Am I dead or insane?
I'm calling, no one can hear me
I'm calling, you know where I must be
C'mon let me out
You've got to set me free
Just to even hear
Ashes to ashes
Is that what he said?
More familiar voices
Lies about the life that I had
I wanna speak that I hear though
A realisation arise
A shovel strikes the earth above
I'm being buried alive
Hello! You've got to set me free
Doesn't anybody hear me
You've got to set me free, hey...
C'mon let me out, c'mon!
You've got to set me free!
