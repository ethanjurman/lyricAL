Workin' this job ain't payin' the bills
Sick and tired rat race takin' my thrills
Kickin' down the road not a dime in my pocket
Nightime falls and I'm ready to rock it
I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day 'cause we're gonna scream
Night songs
Howl into the light singin'
Makes the day right
Raise your glass take a bite
Ridin' to the east and ridin' to the west
Sleepin' all day but never get a rest
Lookin' at the time stand still it ain't right
Livin' for the moment time to get it tight
Night songs [13x]

All right yea
I met this girl around quarter to ten
We made it once she said "make me again"
She wrapped her love around me all night long
In the mornin' we were still goin' strong 
Now let me tell ya it sure feels good
First time I saw that girl I knew it would
Now let me tell ya it sure felt right
No pullin' teeth she didn't want to fight she said 
Shake me
All night 
She said
Shake it don't break it baby
All night
All night long
All night long baby 
Screamed and scratched and rolled out of the bed
I never really got her out of my head
And now and then she makes those social calls
Gives me a squeeze gets me kickin' the walls 
Now let me tell ya it still feels tight
And we were shakin' after every bite
I feel her comin' in the middle of the night
screamin' higher 
ooo yea
All night, keep the fire burnin' cause we're doin' all right
All night, come on and shake it right 
ooo yea 

I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties
I call you on the phone
But never get a rise
So sit there all alone
It's time you realize
I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's foooool
I'm no fooool
Never again no no
You take your road I'll take mine,
The paths have both been beaten
Searchin' for a change of pace
Life needs to be sweetened
I scream my heart out just to make a dime
And with that dime I bought your love
But now I've changed my mind
I'm no fool
since we broke the ties

When you see your face in the mirror
Does it seem the end is gettin' nearer
All your life you spent as a wheeler
Now the hole you dug, it gettin' deeper
You're talkin' words
But they don't make the rhyme
You'll lose it all
Cause you can't draw the line
You got nothin'
Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
And we don't need your kind
Pushin', shovin', got no time
When you see the day gettin' darker
You can run to yuor lies, run to your cover
When you feel the heat from a lover
You hit the highway lookin' for another
You made the grade
You left the hills behind
You take the the cake and eat it
You're so blind
Nothin' for nothin', hey
Hey

See me, feel me, come and touch me
The way I touch you
In the crossfire, live wire
Who said maybe
I said maybe won't do
The sands of time are slipping by
Dust to dust, no second try
You're only goin'
Once around the ride, yea
Once around the ride
Rock hard, got an ace card
I ain't crazy
Just got nothin' to do
Day breaks, I'll take
Can't wait forever
Cause my life will be through

We hang tough
When the chips are low
Can't buy enough
So we steal the show
We get so hot
We can't cool down
So the hell with that
We're rippin' through your town
We've had enough of the raw deals
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels
Like hell on wheels
We live fast
But we love it so
Can't see the past
But it's gone we know
We're burnin' through your town
Run like hell
Hell on wheels

When I was a young boy
they said you're only gettin' older
but how was I to know then
that they'd be cryin' on my shoulder
put your money in a big house
get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
when she connects you with a knife
Somebody get the doctor,
I'm feelin' pretty poor,
somebody get the stretcher
before I hit the floor
Somebody save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree,
save me
Everybody's got opinions
but nobody's got the answers
and the shit you ate for breakfast
well it'll only give ya cancer
We're runnin' in a circle
runnin' to the mornin' light
and if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night
I think I'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
because I ain't got the cash
save me, look out
Save me
I'm goin' down for the last time, look out

I've been loved and I've been shoved
Beaten every step of the way
Lived by the glass
And got a little ass
Three or four times a day
Well, I've seen blood like Noah's flood
I think its gonna take us away
Tellin' you should listen real good
Hell's come back to stay
Well you can't take it with you
It's a one way ride
Baby's had enough of lookin'
In from the outside
Feelin' down low, time to let go
You're only as good as you please
Walk before you crawl, make the last call
You need it like a social disease

I'm gettin' hot
I've got to give a shot
She wants it all
And that's a lot
I'm gettin' ready
The love's lookin' steady
It's gettin' sticky
I thought she might miss me
She looked at me and said
I need a little
Push, push
Gonna give a little
If ya take a little
Then you'll get a little
She's lookin' fine
Flashin' like a neon sign
She thinks it's love
I said that comes with time
Come and give a little
Whoa, yea
Push on
Woo, push, push
Mmm, keep pushin' me
Ooo, yea, yea

I hit the road wide open at seventeen
Mama cried herself to sleep
Lost a dad I'd never seen
Took all my childhood friends
Guitar, and a dream
Some say I got it bad
I say I've got the cream
No, no, no
I roll into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black
Go, go, go
I hit the stage and you make me feel like I'm back
I'm back
Back home again
Back home
I worked from nine to five at twenty-two
Felt good to stay alive
Good times were far and few
Trustin' my hopes and dreams
With someone who said they knew
Just how to make ends meet
They haven't got a clue
I rolled into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black
Take me back
