Sit there thinkin'
In your room
You feel the pressure
You're goin' crazy too
The walls around you
Closin' in
You need a change
Claustrophobic
Feelin' scared
You need somebody
But no one seems to care
A one way ticket
A change of pace
You've had enough
Can't take no more
Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains
Got this letter
Came today
From my baby
Who left me yesterday
Said she loves
She'll come back
She wants to try
I won't let her
She'll be upset
I know it's better
Than somethin' I'll regret
She's been dishonest
And insincere
I lost my mind
Twenty times a year
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains
Woke up today
I'm alone
I look around
But baby you were gone
But I don't mind
And I don't worry
I will survive
Now that you're gone
Don't need nobody
To hold or tie me down
I broke the chains
So let me be
I've gotta be free

I talk with you
I think of her
It always turns out the same
I changed my mind
Then I'm not sure
Love's got me shackled in chains
Win or lose
We've lit the fuse
I've lost control
Then you explore my soul
In the middle
Of love
Torn apart
Right from the start
Is it too late to be true?
Now things have changed
We're not the same
I lose control
I lose my mind as well
Everyday
Love's got me chained

Felony
In tight blue jeans
I did not know
She was so sweet
What ya did to me
The judge said sorry
First degree
You're here in my heart
Felony, felony, felony, yeah
Felony, felony, felony
Well I was shot down
By a heart so cruel
You were were laughin' yeah
You took me for a fool
I'm struck down
Left lyin' in the dirt
I never knew
How much love it hurts
Harvard paid
Detective man
I'm in his sights
I'm on the run
Those tight blue jeans
That drove me wild
She was just a child
Felony, yeah

You keep me waitin'
Why I don't know
Seems like forever
You know the show
I wanna see you
Don't want it to end
But when I'm callin'
You tell me again
I can't see you anymore
All my friends keep tellin' me, yeah
That I'm just a fool
But baby I can't help myself
I'm in love with you
Give me just one chance
And I'll make it right
Could be forever
Don't tell me tonight

Run out of breath
And I feel I'm moving too slow
Backwards and forwards
I don't know which way I should go
There's a solution
To make all your feelings alright
The music's here waiting
So come on and get it tonight
Live to rock
Rock to live
It's all you got when
You're down on the skids
One way or another
Survive until the end
Over and under
I'm feeling the thunder take hold
Feeling it flow through my veins
Rock will never get old
You're down on the skids, yeah
'til the end

It's late at night
I get that feeling running through my veins
You know it drives me insane
In the car, slam the door, turn the key and I'll be free
On that highway tonight
Highway bound
I'm so alive
I'm shifting into overdrive
Nightrider
Autobon
Route 61
I'll drive this road into the sun
My machine is tired and cool
I don't need to go to school
I'll put the hammer down and I'll leave this town
I'm racing time
The freeway just seess to unwind in front of me
And there's no return
My wheels of love
Fit me like a racing glove
Don't touch the brake
Don't cross the line
Don't make mistakes
'Cause you know that I'm
Here I come
The engine roars
I'm locked inside my doors
On a midnight run
But who knows when
Danger lies around the bend for me
With the morning sun
Pass her by
Faster than the speed of light
You better run
Look out now
'Cause here I come

Demon eyes
And the fate is coming down on you
Fire in her eyes
The love she gives she says is all for you
Come the night
You will pay the price
In the night
No one by your side
She will come to you
She take you down
Seven thunders
In her eyes
And no where you can hide
If you can
Won't stop to look at where she's been
All the same
She's telling lies if you believe its true
Comes the night
She'll take you down
She will come and take your life
She will seal your fate
She threw the dice
Seven Thunders
You pay the price
Now she took you in the night
She told you lies
The love she brings is not for you

Staying out all night dancing
You can't keep them at home, no
She'll tease and smile
She'll play for a while
She's got it under control, yeah
I hope it's me tonight
She's looking for
Oh, sweet young girls
I love them all
Young girls
Driving me crazy
The doctor says I must slow down
I gotta leave them alone, yeah
All I know if I'm gonna die
What way to go
You're driving me crazy
Beautiful ladies
I want them all
I love them all, yeah
I want them all, yeah
Those beautiful ladies
Oh yeah
How old you anyway?

Well I've been trying this for so very long
To make you understand
If you'll fight for what you need
Don't come crawling over to me
I'm not the kind of person who quits
Even when the chips are down
You gotta fight for what you want
Don't give up
Stick to your guns
Gotta believe in what you do
A hard time you've been having
Don't feel bad if you're on your own
If you fight for what you want
Things ain't gonna turn out so bad
You gotta stick to your guns
Well, I'll tell you
I gotta tell you
You got to stick to your
You got to stick to your guns

This town I'm in can't take no more
Decadence is silly
You were my woman
Why'd you have to be so hard and cold
Paris is burning
Want to see it from afar
Want to get to where you are
My life's in ruin
The girl I love
She's far away
The distant fire
Brings memories of the love
That I once knew
Where are you now
Been looking all around
And I can't stay
Help me now
I can't stay
Much more before I fade away
Get back where you are
I can't believe
You'd throw it all away
You know you played me for a fool
I'm leavin' now
This time you know
That I'll be gone for good, yeah
Paris is burning, Paris
Paris [Fade Out]

Desperate living- driving me mad
Writings on the wall
Crushed all our hopes and the dreams we once had
Just to watch them fall
Tearing it up in the daytime
Burning it down at night
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail
Last generation- reckless and free
Up against the odds
Thoughts of revenge are going trough me
Fate lies in the cards
Desperate living- trying to see
Breaking all the rules
Only the strongs are gonna be free
From a world of fools

I should've known better
Should've seen right through
Over and over falling in love with you
Wanting you for myself- my first mistake
Finding out the hard way
Was all that I could take
You were just using someone
And I was the one
She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
You're a devil in disguise
Don't wanna hear no lies- no apologies
Imagination gets the best of me
I'm looking everywhere- still I see your face
I'll never forget you- you put me in my place
I've been hypnotized
Now that is over and I've seen right through
Not looking back again I'll start anew
Was making love to you such a wasted time
Maybe I love you, still, I'll get you off my mind
I was taken by surprise

Every night is the same old thing
Baby I tried, yeah I tried
Let's put an end to this misery
Baby I cried, yeah I cried
So hot - stone cold, why'd you let me go
You got a heartless heart
Got a heart of stone
And it's just gonna bring you down
You tell me things that I know ain't true
Baby you lied, yeah you lied
I just wanted to be with you
You got a heartless heart of stone
It's bringing me down- baby
You had to play the only game you've known
With my heart- with my heart- oh

Somebody's watching me, is it just a crazy dream
Is it my memory, playing tricks on me
Out in the streets in the heat of the city
Here comes the night
Sky's turning grey and black
You knew that you were right
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
Just a shadow in the dark, you've seen this face before
Is it just a fantasy, is he coming back for more
Out in the alleyways, there is no second chance
Moving up behind you, you've lost the game at last

Total confusion- one final sin
Someone's religion and greed
Accidents happen, someone to blame
Who's got the answers we need?
I don't know who to believe
But I know who's gonna set me free
Cause I'll be waiting
When heaven comes down
Ashes to ashes, sorrow and shame
Look at the future again
Angels in heaven walking the streets
Searching for someone to blame
Until tomorrow
'Cause I'll be waiting

You weave your spell
Your eyes they beckon me
Your lips they speak, lies and misery
I know it's wrong, but I can't turn away
The flames draw near, they're telling me to stay
(Into the fire) I'm falling
Into the fire
Your love burns bright, and yet the flames are cold
This time I fear, you won't be back no more
When will it end, your love consumes my soul
Into the fire, I'm being tempted once more
Take me back where I came from
Don't wanna see your face no more
You broke my heart, now it's not the same
I'm falling, again

The shootin's over
The smoke is clear
Another notch in my gun
Another round of ammunition
Before the damage is done
She wanted this
I gave her that
She said she will
I took good aim
She felt no pain
When I started moving in for the kill
Cause I've got bullets
Bullets to spare
I've got bullets- bullets to spare
My barrel's ready
My hand is steady
Tonight I'm ready for fun
I got my finger
It's on the trigger
Another night on the run

I'd like to see you in the morning light
I like to feel you when it comes to night
Now I'm here and I'm all alone
Still I know how it feels, I'm alone again
Tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
I said stay, but you turned away
Tried to say that it was me
Now I'm here and I've lost my way
Now I know how it feels, I'm alone again
I tried so hard to make you see
Alone again

I'm like a wildcat at midnight
I'm like a stick of dynamite
Evil senses taking over me
Gonna let the action steal the night
Turn up the heat
Turn down the lights (action, action)
Baby go all night
Turn on the action
Turn on the night
I'm looking over my shoulder
I'm running reckless through the night
Forever young not getting older
Satisfaction guaranteed tonight

I've been lost in the middle
Always trying to find the wishing well
Running around in circles
Never crossing the line
Don't want to touch you
Don't want to see
You've got a knife in your heart
Don't say that you did it for me
Never unchain the night
Don't tell me that the love is gone
Cause there's always another turn
You know right where you want it
But you never gave it in return
Running me in circles
Always crossing the line
Leave you confused
You took the easy way out
When you looked through the eyes of a fool
Don't tell me that the love is strong
Never, never
I'm never gonna set you free

Clouds roll by as I look to the sky
And then the feeling comes, it comes on again
You know desire burns like a fire, fire of sin
Oh, will I ever learn
You're the only one I could call my own
But then the shadows fall and I'm gone again
I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for things
That I might never find again
Care for you, you know that I always will
I know it's hard for you, my taste for the kill
But then it calls to me when the moon rises full in the sky
You know it's not denied
Will I ever find love and peace of mind
On these streets again, will it ever end
You know desire burns like a fire, fire within
I guess I'll never learn
But when the shadows fall, you know I won't be home
Searching for the things

Toss and turn all night in the sheets
I can't sleep
Night after night don't know what it means
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away
In my dreams--it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams--you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
Calling your name, but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles, waiting to see you
In my dreams--you'll always be
In my heart and in my dreams
In my dreams--just the way it used to be
In my dreams--what can I say
In my dreams--You're still by me
And in my dreams--You'll always be
In my dreams--You'll always be
In my dreams--your love is strong
In my dreams--You're still the same

Like a whisper, you came in the night
Gone forever, seems you were right
Long ago, thought it was real
Should've believed love's not forever
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
Darkness comes, so cold
Gentle one, so soft and warm
I tried to touch you, I meant you no harm
Can't seem to hold one
Save me
Long ago, I thought it was real
I should've believed that love's not forever
I just can't hold on
Now that you're gone

The lights go down
You can feel it all around you
Like a razor's edge that cuts through the air
You can hear the sound
It's coming down like thunder
You don't have to tell me why
You don't have to care
When the lightnin' strike again
And the lights go down
And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again
You draw the line
And you leave it all behind you
You lost your mind and then you lose control
By the time
That you feel the lightnin' strike you
You know you've been holding back
You've got to let it go

Told you I had to leave, I had my reasons
I said that it hurt to stay, the way that I'm feelin'
It's not love
That left you standin'
That left you cold
Misunderstandin'
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take
Why, baby, why did you make me let you go
And leave you so lonely
Why, baby, why did you have to hold on
You know it's not love anymore
Gave you your last chance but you didn't believe me
You can't keep me satisfied, the way that you treat me
Why, baby, why, stop playing with my heart
I told you
Telling you to be this way
Sayin' you can never change
When I told you
Is he putting you down
Down, down, down

I didn't know you, but I could see it in your eyes
Shattered dreams and hopes, you'd been hurt too many times
Well I've heard your past from a friend I'd seen today
Told me of your heart, that you had been away
How I wish I could take you away
I would show you that my love's not the same
But I see I've found you too late
Jaded heart
You look but don't see
Love in front of you
You can't believe
Love can't get to you
To bring your heart to me
I realize you've heard it all before
Lies and promises, you don't listen anymore
How I hope that I will find a way
To break down all these walls that you have made
But my eyes see that it's too late
How I wish that I could take you away
Can it be that I found you too late
Jaded Heart

You didn't see me, but I overheard
A short conversation was just a few words
A lie and a whisper, a knife in my back
The things you were saying lead me to believe
You want no part of me
Leave me go, turn and walk away, turn your back on me
If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say
Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Like the way you used to do
Voices that whisper, dark deep despair
Burns me like fire, these things that I hear
Tell me it's over, don't tell me you care
Don't wanna hear it no more
Don't say you love me, if the feeling's not there
Just turn and leave me, I want no part of you
Or I'll be on my way
I won't be back again

In the name of liberty, we set off to the sea
In the name of glory, fighting to be free
But one mistake can set it all to rest
No one sees and no one wins the game of chance
I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise another day
A simple answer, that all of us should see
Let things be what they may be
Open your eyes, do you think that you're the best
Try to see the light before the final test
Will the sun ride, will there be a sky
Someone is watching, waiting to see
If there's a chance before the sun fades for eternity
Will the sun rise, I need to know
Will the sun rise
When it's over

It's too late to tell me you're sorry
It's too late to walk out the door
Last time, last time you left broken hearted
Only to come back for more
I'm not with you for love
You'll be back on your knees again
Til the livin' end
When will it ever end
You know I can't wait
Can't wait, til the livin' end
It was you that wanted affection
It was you and all of your lies
This time, this time I'm changing direction
Changing the look in your eyes
Got no hope for the future
When you live in the past
Not gonna wait for tomorrow
