It's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all
Stand up and shout
Let it out
You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again
You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire, go on, explode

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies
Life's a never-ending wheel, say
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah!
Oh what's becoming of me? No! No!
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy Diver, sole survivor
You're the one who's clean
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you, Holy Diver
Oh Holy Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Hmm hmm hmm

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white
Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail
You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy
Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin
So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right
So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Flying away in the clouds
You know you're losing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow
You can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle

Don't talk to strangers
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down
Hey, you, you know me
You can touch me I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see
Can you feel me?
I'm danger, I'm the stranger
And I, I'm darkness
I'm anger, I'm pain
I, I'm the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away, go
No, no, don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down yeah
Run, run, run, run away

Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all
Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel
And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found
Oh here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one never told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no
But here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
In the middle of the heart
Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right through your heart
And here it comes, here it comes again
Straight through the heart

If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there
She had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And in the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down
It said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away
He was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in mama's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said
You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible
Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and then I took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door
So I go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible
Go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible
I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
Disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me, you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I, we're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear
It calling you beware
Look out
There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark, whoa oh oh

Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
All right
And shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
And I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say, oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh Lord, just go the way you came again
Oh, shame on the night
So I know I'd better run
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh, shame on the night
Here I go, I've got to run
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Well, I lost my hold on the magic flame
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
[evil laughter fading]

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind can penetrate your mind
But sail on, sing your song, carry on
Cause we rock, we rock
We rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices, all giving choices
If we listen, they will say, oh we can find the way
But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
We rock, we rock
Sail on, sing your song, carry on
Ride out, stand and shout, carry on
See how we rock
We rock, that's rock

We're the ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness
That it needs, yeah
We're a laugh without tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming, home
We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never, come home
But the magic that we'll feel
Is worth the lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down
We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
Then quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line
Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies
Between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase
Is worth the pain
We're the last in line, oh
Yeah, we're off to the witch
We may never, never, never come home
Is worth a lifetime
You know we're the throw before the toss
But the only way to go is down
See how we shine
We're the last in
We're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're the laugh without tear
We're the smile without the mirror

You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
'Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn
You're breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, willing to learn

Alright
Dark touches, send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure
I hate the light
I speed at night
At night
Alright!
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've got some stairs to heaven
You may be right
I only know in my world
You've got some stairs to heaven you may be right
I speed at night yeah!
I speed at night night night night night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
I speed at night alright

Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But riders in the night
Can lift you out of sight when they call
That's all
My Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
Then someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
There's no day, no way
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come, steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch?
Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm the poor, I'm the sure
I'm the holy, I'm the pure
I can tell you tales
You just might not believe
One night, one night
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play for
One night touching pretty
But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light
One night
One night feeling pretty
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty in the city
One child went away
And one child stayed to play
Chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up
Where they fall, in the city

Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know, no, no
It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, they'll see you anyway
Evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, evil eyes
They'll follow forever
'Cause they're evil eyes
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes

Can you hear me?
Can you see there's a storm
On the edge of the sky?
Does it matter?
Well, it does to me
And I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder
There should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no-one sees
There is only the dark
Just imagine, will you try?
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine
Not what you want to see

Well, it's been a long hot road I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there, no, no
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light, all right
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out
You've been hungry all of your life, yeah
We speed across emotion
And then we lose our hold
We turn on wheels of passion
That we can't control
So eat your heart out
Run to the shadows and hide
All on fire then he dies, then he dies, then he dies

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine
Then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew
That the chains were on
My, my, my
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand
As it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me
And that's free but still
Your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still, your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
Oh my, the chains were on
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still, the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still, her chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on
The chains were on, the chains were on
Yeah, the chains were on
Seen them walking on the water
The chains were on
Seen them flying through the sky
My, the chains were on
Yes, the chains were on

Oh running into nowhere turning like a wheel and a year becomes a day
Whenever we dream that's when we fly so here is a dream for just you and I
We'll fin the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heart
Oh here we see the wizard staring through the glass and he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie and the things you've got to do yeah
Oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
But oh sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night oh look to the light
Well you fight to kill the dragon and bargain with the beast and sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow and never leave the ground and still you don't know why
Whenever you dream you're holding the key it opens the door to let you be free yeah
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heart
A shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack and he's looking right at you quick
Run along the rainbow before it turns to black attack
And oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
Oh sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart yeah bleeding in the night yeah yeah 
We'll find the sacred heart

She's a rumor in the night it's crazy you can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light it's crazy but you go anywhere
It was just a summer night maybe when a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away maybe to go where where where
She crouches the hunter ready to tell you another lie another lie
You could see the side of someday feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway you were wrong wrong wrong
She jumped at the moment a chance to tell you another lie another lie another lie

You look and you know she's telling you another lie another lie another lie
Why it's crazy when you feel you're getting stronger another lie
Why it's crazy all the lies are getting longer another lie
Who oh yeah another lie another lie

It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door
She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar
The devil of one another
Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody broke a heart
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Without a friend
But they got Rock 'N' Roll
On the night that they cried forever

Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman oh oh oh
Anybody can anybody can sunset superman oh oh oh 

There's perfect harmony in the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness hunted by the lion and the lamb ah ah ah ah
We bring you fantasy we bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle or we will disappear never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away sailed away
We bring you beautiful we teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe or we will disappear never to return again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away they sailed away sailed away
And as we drift along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle and a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds and then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness just lost like them and part of all the pain that they feel yeah
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away leaving nothing nothing more to say all the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful and they'll always let you in
But doors are never open to the child without a trace of sin sail away

Two faces on fire no traces something has swallowed the night you know that nothing can make it all right yeah
Like candy emotion too much and sugar can turn to sand you scream but nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain or do we see just what we are we're naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children guns loaded take aim and blow all the dreams away too late for anything better to say hey
Are we just crazy with the pain or do we see just what we are we are 
Naked in the rain naked in the rain maked in the rain
Two faces no fire no traces fever has turned to snow hearts break to show you the way as you go oh
Are we just running from the pain or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children on fire emotion burns higher guns loaded blow all the dreams away
Naked in the rain naked in the rain frightened by the pain naked in the rain

Seems like heard this song at least a thousand times before 
He just wanted her but she wants more so build a wall keep it all to herself oh oh
Always never seemed to be too much reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains sad remains another victim of overlove overlove
He was just the devil in a thing disquise jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page close the cage on another victim of overlove
Overlove yeah overlove overlove overlove overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone and come the dawn you got another victim of overlove
Overlove overlove overlove love love love love overlove

Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back and everytime there's sunshine I'm blind yeah
I am everybody and everyone that I know is me everyone that I know won't see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer yeah
I'm another number and you know the numbers must agree but everytime the wind blows I can't fly why
We take away tomorrow and never see the end of today lock it up and send it away forever
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star 
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are I could have been a dreamer oh oh
Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back but maybe that was sunshine that I saw
I've heard about a rainbow I've heard it makes you crazy I think I'm goin' crazy crazy 'cause I see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer I could have been the one to fly
I always could have been a dreamer 'cause dreamers never die no
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer dreamer
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer

Give me shelter shelter I can face the day then I'll just fade away give me shelter give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly the fire starts to die you open up your eyes 
Faces in the window noises in the night
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window
We are evil and we are all divine creations of the mind we are pleasure
I see clearly who's behind the wall yes I can see us all
We're faces in the window noises in the night
Give me shelter shelter shelter give me shelter shelter shelter
Faces in the window noises in the night faces in the window hiding from the light
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window
When the fire starts to die and you open up your eyes there they are in the window faces in the window
We are evil and divine just creations of the mind and faces in the window faces in the window

Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move they're shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire burning through your brain turn to face the train oh oh
Hey it's magic said the mother to the child it's stronger than a smile let it go
When a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah when a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah
Just when you think it's pretend here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever maybe we'll still just never know oh oh
Stars move shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire magic shakin' all the earth when a woman cries
Oh oh stars move thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky when a woman cries
When a woman cries aah when a woman cries yeah yeah 
When a woman cries when a woman cries oh

Silence - we hunt for the queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between
Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play hey-hey
Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Silence - we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold
Oh to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more
More's been empty for years
Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you
Small gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon

Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do
The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spider
Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes
Now I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Don't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wild
Why do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hear
Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
A spider
Inside her

You've made it through another day
Driving past the backroads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you
Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun
We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in
Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
No pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel
Some friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my way
Scream at the crazy ones
Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you
Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again
Again, again, again...

I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night - black as heaven
So no-one saw the gun
Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back around
Clutching to monsters in shadows
I can disappear - gone
Better in the dark

If they take away your song
You can finally hear the voices
Of the ones that don't belong
In the face of the rising wind
We all sing Gloria
Is there flame without fire
Most unlikely
If you're there when the walls come down
We all sing - warrior
Is there sight without sound
But we got rock and roll
Rock and roll
Take me anywhere
Is there someone there
On the edge of the last goodbye
Ah the brave never die
Hey, send your heroes of to war
But whisper in their ear
Never cross the song police
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again
For the sake of the left behind
Soon forgotten by time
So unlikely
Cause we got rock and roll
Take you anywhere
Someone's always there
Bring me anywhere
Rock and roll me, ah

You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push
You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
Go on and push

He'd never tell her lies
And she believed in magic
But when the magic died
She could see that all along he's just been
Guilty - a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty - burn in fire
It's time to say goodbye
Don't tell another story
Another alibi
Now you see that all along he's just been
Guilty - you burn in fire
Guilty - the great pretender
You're guilty - just surrender cause you're guilty
Broken promise
But please forgive again
One more time for me
It's the very last time - you'll see
Guilty - liar, liar
You'll burn in fire
Guilty - just surrender, you're guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty
A liar, liar
Guilty - you'll burn in fire
Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire
Surrender - guilty
So guilty

Oh-oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness
Wakes the dead
Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder
And she's afraid
Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
I'll make you safe and warm
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is no more little girl
Don't see her anymore
They disappear
Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today I heard that she was dead
You can hear them only if you try
Goodbye

Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousine
Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio
But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall
Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no
Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall
Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine
And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah

Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the show
The same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son
I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old time
There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Will you need more?
Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh
Where would you be without music
You wouldn't be nowhere it all
You wouldn't be here to invest,oh
If you weren't in heaven no more
One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Well,thank fully we've got the boys
The melody lies fascinated
The rhythm is something divine
Send out a trend of impatience
To see you all movin' so fine
Got to find it soon

Man eatin' momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys
She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
You can take her if you want her you can
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline

Got no silver for my pocket
got no pillow for my head
and the winter it gets stronger
got to ease my aching head
In the morning when I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'm dying
Or I'll got out of my mind
I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my sense reeling
Knowing winter's come to town

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep
She was a cheater
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you
You are a cheater
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go...
This could be or last show
Changing dreams changing schemes... NEVER
We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should I give sorrow, or turn 'round and sneer
I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride
Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall
I can't go on
I, I, I, I...

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open minded,but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said i was there
Lead to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led
Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day,
Is this the way that you get your fun slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun,
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob.
You make me sick getting paid for murder,
But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her.
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds 'cause you won't go to hell.
Take your medal, wear it now with pride.
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside.

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Second to none

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight
Capped everywhere
I've held my licence
It came with birth,
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions
To the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Look around
They're moving in
Hold your ground
When they begin
We can do it
We can do it and if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United we stand one and all
So keep it up
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
[fade]

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
[repeat and fade]

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight
I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance
I'm gonna take
Gonna get out trouble and strife
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise
No I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties
No compromise
Wanna taste what it's like to be free
I'm gonna gather my things
Go through the door
Every night I'll live on my own
I'd like to be there
And I'm gonna be there
I got a will of my own
I go as I please
Fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When I need it
Then I'll ask for advice
[fade]

From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
At every wind what a stake we're in
Is pain better than the grave
When we talk without amend
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike
Kiss of Judas, spider like
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
But you don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm elected protective, detective, Electric Eye!

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light.
Glowin' god of Mars
Body burning bright.
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind.
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power.
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud.
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds.

I've been trying
There's no denying.
It's sending me
Out of my mind.
I've seen reason
Change to treason.
It's losing its sense
Of all kind.
How much longer will it take
For the world to see.
We should learn to live
And simply let it be.
Bloodstone, bloodstone.
In the night time
Wake in fright.
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played.
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made
Bloodstone.
I can't take it.
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that bloodstone.

I move away it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like I thought it would.
Help me, I'm beggin' you please.
You've got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life.
Leave me be.
Take these chains off
Take 'em off of my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave
I tried to run but I'm tied to you like a slave.
It's my fault for loving you so
You were so precious, how could I know.
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me.
I don't owe you anything
Why don't you get out of my life.
Through it all the memories cling
And I can't sleep at night.

I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go.
I've heard the rumours and it seems they're comin' true
do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new.
Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through.
How I suffer for your love.
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried.
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life.
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
You don't know what I like.
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messin' 'round, practice what you preach.
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive

Hey listen don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right.
They're playing at a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear.
Always takin' baby out that's o.k.
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me.
Told you one you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face.
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place.
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace.
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you 'round in the torture before the dread.
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter.
As the sweat is runnin' down your neck
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up.
Oh your heart is pumpin' gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load.
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line.
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake.
I don't talk about it but that's alright
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight.
If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate.

One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud.
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'.
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best.
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.

I'd spend my days alone
I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there.
Like I was in a cell
A captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair.
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control.
Down on the streets below
Bright city lights would glow.
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze
Still counting empty days.
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break the spell.
Fever.  You set my soul on fire.
Fever.  You fill me with desire.
Fever.  You always get it right.
Fever.  All day and all night.
Then one night as I walked
I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar.
Oh how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this.
So destiny has brought us
Oh so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream
At last I'll be with you forever.
And all at once it feels so right.

Hypnotize me
Mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip.
Light my fire
With cold desire
Losing all my grip.
Eat my diamonds
Drinkin' all my gin
Feast your eyes on
A whole lotta sin.
On no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no got your claws stuck in my
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child.
Took my dreams
And now it seems you're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre.
Stop pretendin'
Got me growin' old
Your tormentin's
Fit to snap my soul.
You took my heart
And left it blown to smithereens.
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh
And drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed.
Goin' under
Hear the thunder
Death defying grace.
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face.
Vivious talkin'
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised, so abused
I'm a human sacrifice.

When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you.
You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You Pulled me back to earth
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future
Will you ever set me free
Take me into your arms again
In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain.

Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in
Never stops the Way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
You'll find there's life with victory
With victory on high
Freewheel burning [x8]

Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode - Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down
Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
All your life
Tough as steel
Stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
All your life...

Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figure's primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemned to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives
Now facing one another
The stand-off eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown

When you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise
That's when I crawl
Gliding on mist
Hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss
Evils abound
In the dead of night
Love bites
Into your room
Where in deep sleep
There you lie still
To you I creep
Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend
You smile as I sip
Now you are mine
In my control
One taste of your life
And I own your soul
Softly you stir
Gently you moan
Lust's in the air
Wake as I groan
Love bites you
Invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you
Delights you
It drains you to white
You knew at first sight
You'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite
There'd be no turning back
So come in my arms
I strike any hour
I will return
To trap and devour
Love bites...

Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
And eat me alive
Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver as
You give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as
The rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive

You can look to the left and look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights-flashing colors
Sleepless nights...
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks who are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
And slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day burning hell fire
You're blown away...
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
And the man with the power
No! No! ...

In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days (yeah)
That's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
And there's nowhere to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Then I will wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
And there's no place to go
Oh no!
You won't be there tomorrow
Say it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
And there's no place to go...

I know you like it hot
Love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside ya till the power splits your head
We're gonna rock ya till your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with an iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
So come on let's tell the world

Why do I have to wait so long
Before you come into my life again
Seems as though forever until
I can be here by your side till then
I think you feel the same way too
You know you make my dreams come true
If you'll just turn on your light
Let me see it shining through the night
When I'm far away from here
I'll hold all the memories so clear
If I only have the choice
I would stay so let me hear your voice

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one

When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimensions
It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling
Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings
Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision
An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
Your gonna get richer, I gotta get wild
Any time you want to
Any way you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Live that fantasy
I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane late at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light
You know where we're going
I know where we are
Set the rear view mirror for the backseat of the car
In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you
When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotised
Never seen nothin' like it no,
You won't believe your eyes
Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean
Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling to the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar
Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound
Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night
Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on
Do you love it loud

Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more the pain you'll feel
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice
Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
so expect the worst
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry, is victory, is victory

As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting
Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice
Not begging you
I'm telling you
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night
They're closing in
They'll never win
You won't make me,
As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down
just I'll face you under
Hands of justice
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear

The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me
And carved out of stone
I've broken hearts
Made people sing
I've drove a million miles
I've done everything
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
And no one can take that away
Bring on the night
That's when I live
I come alive inside
Give all I can give
I live each day
Like it's my last
I live for rock and roll
I never look back
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

The greatest times, I've ever known

And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

You get me up, then we both get down
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds
I'm all tied up on your bed
I'd rather be inside your head
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back
Then you ease off with your attack
You're the best I've had if you please
You never stop, you great big tease
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show

It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all
corners of the land
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of
hand
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Impossible to stop
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in
awe
At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for
And millions roared, and millions cheered
This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore en-captured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Pain! Pain!
Killer! Killer!
Can't stop the Painkiller!
Pain!

Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road
Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol
Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground
Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you
Crome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All Guns, All Guns Blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
With a burning heart
Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
No-one survives
Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground
High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing lazer
Burning glaze
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud
It's comin' - Meltdown
Start runnin' - Countdown

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Force rises
False rituals
Baptises
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
The burning sermons consecrate their sin

You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
You're possessing me
In the night please set me free
I can't resist your Touch of Evil
A Touch of Evil
Touch

Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins
Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see
This day will last forever
Deep in the hearts of men
Courage and victory
Remember, remember
One Shot At Glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire
Fighting on with dignity
In life and death we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel
I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
Fight fight fight
Fighting the world every single day
Fighting the world for the right to play
Heavy Metal in my brain
I'm fighting for Metal 'cause it's here to stay
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting the World
I been fighting
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight
Now people keep asking if we're going to change
I look'em in the eye
Tell'em no way
Stripes on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel not clay
See my brother standing by my side
Only got one thing on ever mind
Radio's playing this nation wide
Turn it up louder till we all get fright
Fight - Fighting the World

Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.
What's goin' on now
Don't ya care about me?
Send the same letter to the radio, Ha!
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head
We all like it - Rock And Roll
We all want it - on your show
Play it loud  don't play it low
Blow Your Speakers with Rock And Roll
We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'
People want music to get'em movin'
We don't want labels
We want music on the cable
We want it
We got lotsa stations

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Always Carry On

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me
Are you ready?
Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man
Violence and Bloodshed
Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me
My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end
Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent
Father, father, father
I look up to you and heed thy call
This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be

Damnation, Religion
Salvation, Fire and Steel

I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere
Holy, Holy War
Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Baptized in Fire and Steel
For the end we bring is soon
Now face the storm
A Holy War
Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Black Dogs howl in the night
The Lion is dead!
A Solitary Messenger
The Master of Revenge

Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.
I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Wheels of fire ride

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes
We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down
other bands play Manowar kill

Built a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind, born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise
With fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

Brothers the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the Battle Hymns
Into Glory Ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're Fighting the World
Side by side
On a crusade
The world we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king
Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France
Will not fail
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy
Switzerland, Austria
Back to the Glory of Germany
Sound the Death Tone
On our March for Revenge
Spill the Blood of my Enemies
The Oath of a Friend
Fight the Holy War for The Crown and the Ring
Six magic circles made by the Blood of the Kings
Wherever we ride it's metal we bring
Blood of a king.

[PRELUDE]
[I HECTOR STORMS THE WALL]
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
[II THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS]
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
[III FUNERAL MARCH]
[IV ARMOR OF THE GODS]
[V HECTOR'S FINAL HOUR]
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
[VI DEATH HECTOR'S REWARD]
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Die, die, die...
[VII THE DESECRATION OF HECTOR'S BODY]
[PART 1]
[PART 2]
[VIII THE GLORY OF ACHILLES]
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers go on get out
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers I said
There's metal in the air tonight, can you hear it call
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky

The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.
Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me
When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die
Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave
There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind

In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring

Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die
Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine
We are the undefeated we're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel
Livin hard and ridin fast
No one controls our goddam lifes

Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son

In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky
From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion it's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight
We believe in the power and the might
We're here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

Some want to think hope is lost see me stand alone
I can't do what others may want then I'll have no home
So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage ride into the night
Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul will point the way to victory
If there's a fight then I'll be there, I'll be there
So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Lift your wings up high my friend fearless to the end

We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king
All of the dreams held deep inside have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king

I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell

When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
[Repeat 3, 4, 5, chorus to fade]

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
[Repeat chorus]
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song
[Repeat chorus to fade]

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
[Bridge:]
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
[Chorus:]
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
[Repeat bridge, chorus]
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
[Chorus:]
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
[Repeat chorus]
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived
[Repeat chorus, 2nd verse, chorus]

Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
[Repeat chorus]
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
[Repeat all]

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
We know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land

We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

We are trying to get the message to you

Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Now your ships are burned
And the evil has returned
It will creep upon you
There's nothing to do
It will rip up your mind
And death you will find
Life is just a game
And death is just the same
Within the blood stained walls
In the center of your brain
Demons without mercy
Driving you insane
When the Orders are obeyed
And you have been slayed
You're lying on the ground
Without making a sound
As your soul fades away
You can hear someone say:
Ring the dooms day bell,
Turn the world into hell!

There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Because I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me
I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side
I'm trying to fight
For what is right
But evil spirits pass me by
They do what they want
They just don't care
What you feel or what you say
Where the road is leading us

No... No!
I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars
Who's to run and who's to fight?
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die
Who's to lose and who's to win?
I'll see the light tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life tonight!
Now the chaos has begun, people crying out
You're all alone, you gotta run!
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide
No we never had a chance!
No... Oh Oh Oh Oh!
Take my life tonight

You say the end of time is coming far too near
My love for life is torn in vain through all the years
What's the answer to the question
that we have been searching for
Can you tell?
Don't wanna fall apart before we have a chance
to try again
Don't let it end...
I tried so hard to make it right for you and I
Your sacred promises have all become a lie
Is this your idea of destiny?
'Cause if it is, just set me free
You can not fool me with your stories being told
My God it brings me down, I feel I'm growing old
No, please don't end it now, there is so much more
We can do, you know...don't let it end...
Let's gather what we had and build it up, again
It used to be so good, oh, please don't let it end

In the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall openIn the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall open

Oh Yeah!
I am a Viking I’m going out to war
I've got death upon my mind
As I was leavin' oh yesterday
I've got no fear in my heart
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through the waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah!
I am a warrior my mind is set to kill
Life or death is on the line
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel
I've got your life right in my hand
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah yeah! yeah!
You are a loser and it's such a shame
That you're a fool and you don't know
That I’m a Viking I'll walk all over you
And by my sword you will die
Dragon ships are charging through those waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah…yeah!
No No No… No!

No more will I do all the things that I've done
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find
His soul had wandered through years of despair
Eyes without expression told to beware
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high
To find they're forgotten to rest and to die

Outcast, not knowing right from wrong
Surrounded by women, wine, and song
Never still always on the run
Prince of the night, killing with a gun
Now, he's taken a life away
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay
Renegade, he fled from town to town
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down
For his head, lies a might price
He's a wanted man, dead or alive
Where will he go from here
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...
He's got mixed emotions running through his head
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead
He's on the run, again
Tell me when will it end

Now the battle is over, the clouds're hanging low
Dead bodies lie on the ground
Marched into slaughter, lost souls fought in vain
No glory or pride to be found
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around
Trying to find my way home
Fighting for honour and medals of gold
But, they were to kill or be killed
Slaying the enemy, not knowing why
Keep low and fire at will
Lost out in action, long gone forever
Just a boy that died in vain
His mother is crying, his father not proud
Twisted gray faces in the rain
Trying to find my way home...

Just an ordinary day, all around it seems O.K.
With a normal view
Then you open up your eyes, suddenly you realize
Everyone's confused
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be
Everyone around is sad, but, they analyze you mad
Sayin' you've lost your mind
Seems their lives have been abused
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find
Seems the whole society in the world's insanity

It was you, it was me,
And we would last forever.
Any fool could see, that we were 
Meant to be
Without you, there is no meaning to
My life.
You're gone and it cuts me like
A knife.
How could you leave me?
You don't remember, I'll never forget
You just don't remember, I'll never forget.
Why did you turn away,
Let your love fade away and die.
You became so cold, you made me feel
So old.
When you left, you broke my heart
And just to see.
How many pieces there would be,
After you leave me.
You just don't remember, I'll never forget

You came to me
You said you were my friend
I shared my art and my mind.
You found it easier
To steal than create.
Then call it your's, though it's mine
You can't fight, what is right
Face the truth, liar
You can't feel, you just steal
You smile in my face,
When I turn around,
You stick a knife in my back.
You think you're clever,
You know you're insane,
You're lies are not white they are black.

They all were there, the court was full
The king beside his queen
His love was cold, the fool will dance
for her 'till end of time,
The queen is in love,
The queen is in love.
She couldn't help her burning heart,
And now he's burning too.
Their love was blind,
They will dance until the end of time.
Queen is in love
The furious king now has learned
He sentenced them to burn.
Forever one,
They are joined in death eternally

I now will tell you all a story,
That no one ever heard before.
It is the tale about the fury,
Remember wisdom is your strength.
It said you're such a fool
Just let my evil rule
No, it's burning like a flame,
Now nothing seems the same.
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
It's wish is my command.
Enslaved forever by the fury,
By the fury, no!
At first it came to me in visions,
And that was filling me with pain
And when my fear became desire,
To let the demon burn my soul.
It said "Don't fight in vain,"
"I'll make you love the pain."
I now have told you all my story
And still for you its not too late.
Don't draw your sword
Just use your wisdom
And never let this be your fate.
Oh, no it's here again,
This demon loves the pain.

Born with the fire in my blood,
Can't live without it.
Something that gold can never buy.
It doesn't matter who you are,
Or what your thinking,
If you believe in what you try.
Feel the fire,
Your burning desire.
Fire, I'm burning up with fire
Fire, feel it burning higher
If you are rich, or if you are poor,
There is no difference,
It's still in what you're fighting for.
If you are strong you will survive,
You'll feel the fire,
Burning on forever more.
Feel the fire
Your burning desire
Fire, I'm burning up with desire
You never play with fire.

Everyone is searching for the
Meaning of our life.
Reading 'bout the hell and heaven
Believing all those lies.
Look upon yourself
Imagine you are two
Power lies within this is true.
Can't you see its clear like a mirror
It's all within what you're searching for
Magic mirror, magic mirror
Now your eyes are open,
and you know you were a fool.
You always had the power,
But you never broke the rules.
Power lies within this is true
Magic mirror, Magic mirror
Once again I say,
The strength that we are all searching for,
High and low we all looked in vain
Can't you see, it's clear like a mirror.
It's all within what you're searching for.

In the time, when darkness ruled
No one saw the light
In the cold black emptiness
Victims of the night
You can't fight what you can't see
To be or not to be
In the dark ages
Those evil days will still remain,
Till someone breaks the chains.
Just the strong survive,
You have to try, or you will die.
In the Dark ages

Out of the darkness, the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong
The lightning, strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I hear a rising force
Searching my soul, now I find something else
I take my life in my hands
Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The power is at my command
The lightning strikes, cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
I feel a rising force
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
The rising force starts to shine
A burning inferno, it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind

Look at me, see the love that you're missing
Can't you see that I'll always be there
You can't run you can't hide from the feeling tonight
Damage done. I guess love isn't fair.
Sometimes I wonder who you are
So close, but we've gone too far.
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl.
Lonely days, fill my nights with such sorrow
Shades of grey, turn into blue tomorrows.
Sometimes I wonder where you are
So close, but your eyes are so far.
You're gone and I can't go on and now my heart cries for you girl.

Lost in a dream in the arms of the night
Two lonely prisoners of our own device
Don't let me go. Hold on together
You wanna know if love can be real
I wanna take everything I can steal
Love on the line, it's now or never.
Why can't the night last forever.
This could be Paradise
Holding you here by my side
If we just close our eyes
We'll be in Heaven tonight.
Run through the night down streets of desire
Burning my soul, my heart's on fire
Give up the fight, it's sweet surrender
With trembling hands we reach for it all
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall
I need you now, now more than ever.
This feels like Paradise
I see the world in our eyes
If we just hold on tight

Shades of night, fall upon my eyes
Lonely world fades away
Misty light, shadows start to rise
Lonely world fades away.
In my dreams your face is all I see
Through the night you share your love with me.
Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.
Here we are on the crossroads of forever
Shining star lights the way.
Walk with me on the winds of time
Love's mystery is for us to find.
Until that day, until the day I find you
I won't rest, I won't let go
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you
To warm my heart and fill my soul.

Locked up in chains, backs to the wall
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call
Pushed from outside, thrown underground
Frozen in time we wait for the sound.
Oh, I feel something coming
Looks like a riot in the dungeon.
Trapped behind bars, prisoners of death
All hope is ours, we can't give up yet
Ready to fight to get what we need
Die on your feet or live on your knees.
Looks like a riot in the dungeon
You stand and die or start your running
'Cause there's a riot in the dungeon.
It's got to give, it's gonna break
Dying to live, our freedom's at stake
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood
We won't give in till they've had enough.

I always knew, somewhere in time
We'd meet again, we'd cross that line
Don't need to question, no reason why
The answer lies before your eyes.
Do you know who I am
Do you understand?
Deja vu, dreams come true
I see my soul inside of you
Deja vu, so many lives
Familiar spirits behind your eyes.
We cross between worlds through windows of light
With open arms we hold back the night
The crystal of power we hold in our hands
We go on forever and love is the plan.

We hold the secret to a dream
We keep it wrapped in chains
Locked inside a mystery.
We climb a stairway to the stars
Through doorways of the heart
Step inside, the magic starts.
Gaze into my crystal ball,
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.
You veil your eyes in fantasy
Time to pull the curtain back
Distant worlds, so much to see.
I wanna know you, come on let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you, reach out to these hands of fate
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

Hold on tight in the heat of the night
Baby there can be no escape
Feelings right, getting hard to fight
Baby how much more can I take.
Tell me that it's real, everything you feel
What am I supposed to do
Look into my eyes, touch me deep inside
Let me feel your love cut through.
Oh, now is the time
Feeling your heart so close to mine
Oh, I want your touch, need you so much
Now is the time for our love.
Drowning in the flames, in the sea of desire
Angel with the devil's eyes
Turn up the heat and we fall in the fire
Can't you feel the temperature rise.
Tell me that it's true, you can feel it too
Let me be your fantasy
Baby hold me tight, say that it's alright
You know you can count on me.
When the fire starts I can feel you burning tonight
With an open heart baby won't you let me inside,
Let me inside girl.

Step inside the dream machine
You're on a power drive
Feel the passion of the beast
Watch her come alive.
Oh, you're almost there, ride on silver air
You better hold on tight, she's fire in the night.
Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.
Got your hands upon the wheel
The pedal to the floor
Now it's time for nerves of steel
Hear the engine roar.
Oh, you shoot the thrill, heading for the kill
No control tonight, she's liquid dynamite.
Rev it to the Red line
You're tearing up the street
12 cylinders and she's all mine
She's too tough to beat
Oh, you shoot to thrill 
Heading for the kill
No control tonight
she's liquid dynamite

To be lonely is my only trust
In my silent movies 
I can expose my lust
Taking snapshots in the light
That I do recall when I retire
Playing with my fantasies I let the curtain fall
In my desire
Still I need that touch for real
To discover and to feel
You're the one that breaks my heart
And it's tearing me apart
Making love to you baby
Making love it's all I want
Making love
Every subway-every crowded street
Feeding my emotions
We pass but never meet
My touch is two dimensional
I slowly close my eyes and think of you
More or less invisible
Still you're my point of view
I can't get to you

Come on baby, what's on your mind
You're stumbling in the darkness
Like you're running blind
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
This same old graveyard
on the same playground
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round

Once we were one 
Now we're worlds apart
Deep inside you know you are my other heart
My memories seem like yesterday
Can't believe it's all so far away
All these years
All our tears
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
You said to me
That we hold the key
Eternal love we give and take
It was meant to be
My love for you
Was always true

With your love you gave me life
Not knowing right from wrong
You always know that I'll be strong
You set me free and you paid the price
You inspired me in my art
With the rebel in your heart
You gave nothing for nothing
But the spirit of you word happiness could bring
I learned to always do the best I can
You taught me to be true and I never ran
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Left all alone in the cold
Nowhere to go so I run like the wild
Stumbling, falling
Crying calling you...
As they gave nothing in return
You became their slave although you were brave
You still teach me what is left to learn
Though they brought you to the grave
You will remain to ease my pain

Don't ever try to fool me
Cause I can see right through you
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
Hold me, feel me
Wound and heal me
Mend this broken heart
Though you're near me
You can't hear me
But you tear my soul apart
I can't beat you
Can't defeat you
You just make me cry inside
Don't even try to fool me
My rage is growing stronger
And I can't wait no longer
Never learning
Vengeance is burning
Deep inside your mind
Time will come to
When I'll make you
Stumbling like blind leading the blind

I cast my pearls before the swine
Sealed and delivered
Then I drink your toast of wine
Though it's bitter sweet
I'm eating from you hand so neat
Pennies from heaven
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live 
Judas...Judas
Sightseeing through the lights
and shades of you mighty colonnades
No I got the picture
of the beauty and the beast
I am the lamb...you are the priest
To crucify me
To make a living...Makes no difference
Friends, you are what you do
Some are false and some are true
You haven't got a clue
I'd rather reign in hell some said
Than serve in heaven

I was carried to you
By the hands of my fate
Thought it was too late
I wasn't the type that believed in true love
At first sight
you changed it to the right
I know what I feel
This is real
I give you my body and soul
Let your resistance drop
Don't have to stop
By the siren's call
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I'm not the type to believe
in a second chance
Or in sweet romance
I'm no beginner been fooling around before
Still coming back for more
Today is different
It was meant
I've found a reason
There's more than one season
Time to think it over

My one way ride in dead end street
Leading to victory and glory
You seek I hide you'll find defeat
My future's in the hands of fury
You try - but never win
Can't you see I am the demon driver
Don't lie it is a sin
Cuz you know I am the demon driver
I live to drive and never wait
For guardian angels riding by me
To speed or die I'm never late
Wherever you are there will be

Something deep inside, far from reality
We pretend it never crossed our mind
we feel but never sense
Building up a strong defense
Some say it's our destiny, Lord...
We're living on the faultline
Get out of here
Cry the prophets of our time
Fear the signs
Save those you love and all your children
You life depends on castles in the sand
Don't look back there is no promised land
We don't want to hear that this could be the day
So much for science fiction
as you always say
But soon the day will come
It's only just begun
For the people on the faultline
it's no use to pray
Why living in danger
Why living in danger, danger

Can't bow for a rule
Cause I'm nobody's fool
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win
Sometimes I might be rude
Acting in my mood
I'm trying to be straight
Cause I don't want to be late
There's nothing you can say to make
me feel worse than I do (how are you)
You can't buy my freedom
Keep me locked in your cell
Sad how we waste our energy
When all our days are few (makes me blue)
We're two of a kind me and you
I guess that I'll see you in hell
Who is my friend
Who will remain
Seems like I always stand alone in the end
Nobody lasts until the end
You can't buy my life and freedom
It's more than just buy and sell
You can't keep me locked in your cell
See you in hell
