U.S. prime, grade A stamped guaranteed 
Just grease it up and bring on the heat 
Throw it down and roll it over once or twice 
Then chow down 
[Chorus]
She's good enough, good enough to huh! 
I can't get enough, I can't get enough 
She's good enough to huh! 
Hey me yea I been working up an appetite 
Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs 
I like to open up with a little six on the half shell 
Then it's 3-6-9 times 
Hey waitress you got any specials here tonight 
Me and the fellas might be interested in 
Rack a what 
Well I'll have some of that 
I'll be the first to say that I'm blind to the world 
Cause I'm two days gone and I just can't see 
But I ain't no fool and honey I know a good thing 
And she's comin' she's comin' 
So come on, come on, come on cause she's 
Good, good, good enough 
Good, good, good enough ohhh!

Oh here it comes again 
That funny feelin again winding me up inside 
Every time we touch 
Hey I don't know 
Just tell me where to begin cause I never ever 
Felt so much 
[Chorus 1:]
No I can't recall any love at all 
Baby this blows 'em all away 
[Chorus 2:]
It's got what it takes 
So tell me why can't this be love 
Straight from my heart oh tell me why 
Can't this be love 
I tell myself 
Hey only fools rush in an only time will tell 
If we stand the test of time 
All I know 
You've got to run to win an I'll be damned if 
I'll get hung up on the line 
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Solo]
Tell me why can't this be love 
Baby why can't this be love 
Got to know why can't this be love 
I wanna know why can't this be love

[Chorus 1:]
Feel like throwing in the towel don't be a fool 
They're out to knock you out, put you down 
For the count 
Watch the left, watch the right, below 
The belt 
They'll run you round and round it's plain to see 
It's never gonna stop they'll run ya till you drop 
There ain't no power around can keep a good man down 
[Chorus 2:]
There's still some fight in me 
That's how it'll always be 
Hold your head up high, look 'em in the eye, never say die 
Get up and make it work 
You say that love has got you down well that's bull 
If love has got you down then love can pick you right back up 
Walking down a dead end street 
No mercy at your feet 
They're holding all the cards, making things so hard, before it goes too far 
Get up and make it work
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts fallin' down
Better change your tune
You reach for the golden ring
Reach for the sky
Baby just spread your wings
We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind
Run, run, run, away
Like a train runnin' off the track
The truth gets left behind
And falls between the cracks
Standing on broken dreams
But never losing sight
But you spread your wings
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
Ohh that's what dreams are made of
Oh baby we belong in a world that must be strong
[Solo]
Higher and higher leave it all behind
Oh, we'll get higher and higher who knows what we'll find
Ohh, that's what dreams are made of
Ohh, baby we belong in a world that must be strong
And in the end on dreams we will depend
Cause thats what love is made of

Ain't no way I'm stayin' home tonight 
I'll be out until the mornin' light 
Just hangin' 'round the local parking lot 
Checkin' out the girls see what they got 
Yea they love it when me and the boys 
Start playin' love with them human toys 
Yea we just wind 'em up and let 'em go, oh yea 
[Chorus:]
Summer nights and my radio 
That's all we need baby don't cha know 
We celebrate when the the gang's all here 
Hot summer nights that's my time of the year 
We made it through the cold 
This freezin' snow is gettin' really old 
Next year I'll head out for the coast 
Say boys I think that might just call for a toast, yea 
I got a line, you got a pole 
I'll meet you down at the ole fishing hole 
Yea them girls are biting good tonight 
Oh yea, uh oh, oh yea 
[Chorus]

I don't know what I been livin' on but it's 
Not enough to fill me up 
I need more than just words can say 
I need everything this life can give me 
Come on baby close your eyes let go 
This can be everything we've dreamed 
It's not work, that makes it work no 
Let the magic do the work for you 
[Chorus 1:]
Cause something heached out and touched me 
Now I see that all I want... 
[Chorus 2:]
I want the best of both worlds 
And baby I know what it's worth 
We can have have the best of both worlds a little 
Heaven right here on earth
There's a picture in the gallery of a 
Fallen angel looked alot like you 
We forget where we come from sometimes 
I had a dream it was really you 
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Solo]
You don't have to die to go to heaven 
Or hang around to be born again 
Just tune into what this place has got to offer 
Cause we may never be here again 

Contact
Is all it takes
To change your life
To lose your place in time
Contact!
Asleep or awake
Coming around
You may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever you realize
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Reach for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Another world
Some other time
You lay your sanity
On the line
Familiar faces
Familiar sights
Reach back
Remember with all your might
Ooh there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down
Sleep and dream that's all I crave
I travel far across the Milky Way
To my master I become a slave
'Til we meet again some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before
Baby, pull the string

The love line is never straight and narrow
Unless your love is tried and true
We take our chance with new beginnings
Still we try, win or lose
Take the highs with the blues 
Always one more, you're never satisfied 
Instead of 'one for all' with you, it's only 'one for me'
Oh, when I draw the line and meet you half the way 
And you don't know what that means 
I feel like a running politician
Just trying to please you all the time
I'm giving you my share with no condition
Going wide, running long
Feeling lost but not for long 
So I draw the line and meet you half the way 
When you don't know what that means 
Always one more, you're never satisfied
So I draw the line and meet you half the way
When you don't know what that means
I'll meet you half the way! 
I'll meet you half the way

It's not what you are 
It's how you dress 
That's one thing I've learned from the guys 
I must confess 
Now me, look, I got this job not just beeing myself 
Huh uhh 
I went out and bought some brand new shoes 
Now I walk like someone else 
Maybe I'm crazy or just too high 
But all this can't be worth my 
Piece of the pie 
Sittin 'round just gettin' high 
Temporarily pacified 
I guess less is more 
Something special, something new 
Some brand new group to sink my teeth into 
Sittin 'round just getting high 
[Chorus:]
That's what's going down on the inside 
Don't let this get around to the outside 
This ain't no party, this ain't no show! 
So don't be tryin' to putt no mo jo on my butt, anyway 
[Solo]
[Chorus x4]
