Now your ships are burned
And the evil has returned
It will creep upon you
There's nothing to do
It will rip up your mind
And death you will find
Life is just a game
And death is just the same
Within the blood stained walls
In the center of your brain
Demons without mercy
Driving you insane
When the Orders are obeyed
And you have been slayed
You're lying on the ground
Without making a sound
As your soul fades away
You can hear someone say:
Ring the dooms day bell,
Turn the world into hell!

There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Because I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me
I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side
I'm trying to fight
For what is right
But evil spirits pass me by
They do what they want
They just don't care
What you feel or what you say
Where the road is leading us

No... No!
I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars
Who's to run and who's to fight?
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die
Who's to lose and who's to win?
I'll see the light tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life tonight!
Now the chaos has begun, people crying out
You're all alone, you gotta run!
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide
No we never had a chance!
No... Oh Oh Oh Oh!
Take my life tonight

You say the end of time is coming far too near
My love for life is torn in vain through all the years
What's the answer to the question
that we have been searching for
Can you tell?
Don't wanna fall apart before we have a chance
to try again
Don't let it end...
I tried so hard to make it right for you and I
Your sacred promises have all become a lie
Is this your idea of destiny?
'Cause if it is, just set me free
You can not fool me with your stories being told
My God it brings me down, I feel I'm growing old
No, please don't end it now, there is so much more
We can do, you know...don't let it end...
Let's gather what we had and build it up, again
It used to be so good, oh, please don't let it end

In the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall openIn the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall open

Oh Yeah!
I am a Viking I’m going out to war
I've got death upon my mind
As I was leavin' oh yesterday
I've got no fear in my heart
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through the waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah!
I am a warrior my mind is set to kill
Life or death is on the line
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel
I've got your life right in my hand
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah yeah! yeah!
You are a loser and it's such a shame
That you're a fool and you don't know
That I’m a Viking I'll walk all over you
And by my sword you will die
Dragon ships are charging through those waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah…yeah!
No No No… No!

No more will I do all the things that I've done
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find
His soul had wandered through years of despair
Eyes without expression told to beware
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high
To find they're forgotten to rest and to die

Outcast, not knowing right from wrong
Surrounded by women, wine, and song
Never still always on the run
Prince of the night, killing with a gun
Now, he's taken a life away
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay
Renegade, he fled from town to town
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down
For his head, lies a might price
He's a wanted man, dead or alive
Where will he go from here
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...
He's got mixed emotions running through his head
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead
He's on the run, again
Tell me when will it end

Now the battle is over, the clouds're hanging low
Dead bodies lie on the ground
Marched into slaughter, lost souls fought in vain
No glory or pride to be found
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around
Trying to find my way home
Fighting for honour and medals of gold
But, they were to kill or be killed
Slaying the enemy, not knowing why
Keep low and fire at will
Lost out in action, long gone forever
Just a boy that died in vain
His mother is crying, his father not proud
Twisted gray faces in the rain
Trying to find my way home...

Just an ordinary day, all around it seems O.K.
With a normal view
Then you open up your eyes, suddenly you realize
Everyone's confused
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be
Everyone around is sad, but, they analyze you mad
Sayin' you've lost your mind
Seems their lives have been abused
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find
Seems the whole society in the world's insanity

It was you, it was me,
And we would last forever.
Any fool could see, that we were 
Meant to be
Without you, there is no meaning to
My life.
You're gone and it cuts me like
A knife.
How could you leave me?
You don't remember, I'll never forget
You just don't remember, I'll never forget.
Why did you turn away,
Let your love fade away and die.
You became so cold, you made me feel
So old.
When you left, you broke my heart
And just to see.
How many pieces there would be,
After you leave me.
You just don't remember, I'll never forget

You came to me
You said you were my friend
I shared my art and my mind.
You found it easier
To steal than create.
Then call it your's, though it's mine
You can't fight, what is right
Face the truth, liar
You can't feel, you just steal
You smile in my face,
When I turn around,
You stick a knife in my back.
You think you're clever,
You know you're insane,
You're lies are not white they are black.

They all were there, the court was full
The king beside his queen
His love was cold, the fool will dance
for her 'till end of time,
The queen is in love,
The queen is in love.
She couldn't help her burning heart,
And now he's burning too.
Their love was blind,
They will dance until the end of time.
Queen is in love
The furious king now has learned
He sentenced them to burn.
Forever one,
They are joined in death eternally

I now will tell you all a story,
That no one ever heard before.
It is the tale about the fury,
Remember wisdom is your strength.
It said you're such a fool
Just let my evil rule
No, it's burning like a flame,
Now nothing seems the same.
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
It's wish is my command.
Enslaved forever by the fury,
By the fury, no!
At first it came to me in visions,
And that was filling me with pain
And when my fear became desire,
To let the demon burn my soul.
It said "Don't fight in vain,"
"I'll make you love the pain."
I now have told you all my story
And still for you its not too late.
Don't draw your sword
Just use your wisdom
And never let this be your fate.
Oh, no it's here again,
This demon loves the pain.

Born with the fire in my blood,
Can't live without it.
Something that gold can never buy.
It doesn't matter who you are,
Or what your thinking,
If you believe in what you try.
Feel the fire,
Your burning desire.
Fire, I'm burning up with fire
Fire, feel it burning higher
If you are rich, or if you are poor,
There is no difference,
It's still in what you're fighting for.
If you are strong you will survive,
You'll feel the fire,
Burning on forever more.
Feel the fire
Your burning desire
Fire, I'm burning up with desire
You never play with fire.

Everyone is searching for the
Meaning of our life.
Reading 'bout the hell and heaven
Believing all those lies.
Look upon yourself
Imagine you are two
Power lies within this is true.
Can't you see its clear like a mirror
It's all within what you're searching for
Magic mirror, magic mirror
Now your eyes are open,
and you know you were a fool.
You always had the power,
But you never broke the rules.
Power lies within this is true
Magic mirror, Magic mirror
Once again I say,
The strength that we are all searching for,
High and low we all looked in vain
Can't you see, it's clear like a mirror.
It's all within what you're searching for.

In the time, when darkness ruled
No one saw the light
In the cold black emptiness
Victims of the night
You can't fight what you can't see
To be or not to be
In the dark ages
Those evil days will still remain,
Till someone breaks the chains.
Just the strong survive,
You have to try, or you will die.
In the Dark ages

Out of the darkness, the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong
The lightning, strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I hear a rising force
Searching my soul, now I find something else
I take my life in my hands
Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The power is at my command
The lightning strikes, cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
I feel a rising force
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
The rising force starts to shine
A burning inferno, it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind

Look at me, see the love that you're missing
Can't you see that I'll always be there
You can't run you can't hide from the feeling tonight
Damage done. I guess love isn't fair.
Sometimes I wonder who you are
So close, but we've gone too far.
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl.
Lonely days, fill my nights with such sorrow
Shades of grey, turn into blue tomorrows.
Sometimes I wonder where you are
So close, but your eyes are so far.
You're gone and I can't go on and now my heart cries for you girl.

Lost in a dream in the arms of the night
Two lonely prisoners of our own device
Don't let me go. Hold on together
You wanna know if love can be real
I wanna take everything I can steal
Love on the line, it's now or never.
Why can't the night last forever.
This could be Paradise
Holding you here by my side
If we just close our eyes
We'll be in Heaven tonight.
Run through the night down streets of desire
Burning my soul, my heart's on fire
Give up the fight, it's sweet surrender
With trembling hands we reach for it all
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall
I need you now, now more than ever.
This feels like Paradise
I see the world in our eyes
If we just hold on tight

Shades of night, fall upon my eyes
Lonely world fades away
Misty light, shadows start to rise
Lonely world fades away.
In my dreams your face is all I see
Through the night you share your love with me.
Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.
Here we are on the crossroads of forever
Shining star lights the way.
Walk with me on the winds of time
Love's mystery is for us to find.
Until that day, until the day I find you
I won't rest, I won't let go
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you
To warm my heart and fill my soul.

Locked up in chains, backs to the wall
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call
Pushed from outside, thrown underground
Frozen in time we wait for the sound.
Oh, I feel something coming
Looks like a riot in the dungeon.
Trapped behind bars, prisoners of death
All hope is ours, we can't give up yet
Ready to fight to get what we need
Die on your feet or live on your knees.
Looks like a riot in the dungeon
You stand and die or start your running
'Cause there's a riot in the dungeon.
It's got to give, it's gonna break
Dying to live, our freedom's at stake
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood
We won't give in till they've had enough.

I always knew, somewhere in time
We'd meet again, we'd cross that line
Don't need to question, no reason why
The answer lies before your eyes.
Do you know who I am
Do you understand?
Deja vu, dreams come true
I see my soul inside of you
Deja vu, so many lives
Familiar spirits behind your eyes.
We cross between worlds through windows of light
With open arms we hold back the night
The crystal of power we hold in our hands
We go on forever and love is the plan.

We hold the secret to a dream
We keep it wrapped in chains
Locked inside a mystery.
We climb a stairway to the stars
Through doorways of the heart
Step inside, the magic starts.
Gaze into my crystal ball,
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.
You veil your eyes in fantasy
Time to pull the curtain back
Distant worlds, so much to see.
I wanna know you, come on let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you, reach out to these hands of fate
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

Hold on tight in the heat of the night
Baby there can be no escape
Feelings right, getting hard to fight
Baby how much more can I take.
Tell me that it's real, everything you feel
What am I supposed to do
Look into my eyes, touch me deep inside
Let me feel your love cut through.
Oh, now is the time
Feeling your heart so close to mine
Oh, I want your touch, need you so much
Now is the time for our love.
Drowning in the flames, in the sea of desire
Angel with the devil's eyes
Turn up the heat and we fall in the fire
Can't you feel the temperature rise.
Tell me that it's true, you can feel it too
Let me be your fantasy
Baby hold me tight, say that it's alright
You know you can count on me.
When the fire starts I can feel you burning tonight
With an open heart baby won't you let me inside,
Let me inside girl.

Step inside the dream machine
You're on a power drive
Feel the passion of the beast
Watch her come alive.
Oh, you're almost there, ride on silver air
You better hold on tight, she's fire in the night.
Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.
Got your hands upon the wheel
The pedal to the floor
Now it's time for nerves of steel
Hear the engine roar.
Oh, you shoot the thrill, heading for the kill
No control tonight, she's liquid dynamite.
Rev it to the Red line
You're tearing up the street
12 cylinders and she's all mine
She's too tough to beat
Oh, you shoot to thrill 
Heading for the kill
No control tonight
she's liquid dynamite

To be lonely is my only trust
In my silent movies 
I can expose my lust
Taking snapshots in the light
That I do recall when I retire
Playing with my fantasies I let the curtain fall
In my desire
Still I need that touch for real
To discover and to feel
You're the one that breaks my heart
And it's tearing me apart
Making love to you baby
Making love it's all I want
Making love
Every subway-every crowded street
Feeding my emotions
We pass but never meet
My touch is two dimensional
I slowly close my eyes and think of you
More or less invisible
Still you're my point of view
I can't get to you

Come on baby, what's on your mind
You're stumbling in the darkness
Like you're running blind
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
This same old graveyard
on the same playground
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round

Once we were one 
Now we're worlds apart
Deep inside you know you are my other heart
My memories seem like yesterday
Can't believe it's all so far away
All these years
All our tears
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
You said to me
That we hold the key
Eternal love we give and take
It was meant to be
My love for you
Was always true

With your love you gave me life
Not knowing right from wrong
You always know that I'll be strong
You set me free and you paid the price
You inspired me in my art
With the rebel in your heart
You gave nothing for nothing
But the spirit of you word happiness could bring
I learned to always do the best I can
You taught me to be true and I never ran
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Left all alone in the cold
Nowhere to go so I run like the wild
Stumbling, falling
Crying calling you...
As they gave nothing in return
You became their slave although you were brave
You still teach me what is left to learn
Though they brought you to the grave
You will remain to ease my pain

Don't ever try to fool me
Cause I can see right through you
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
Hold me, feel me
Wound and heal me
Mend this broken heart
Though you're near me
You can't hear me
But you tear my soul apart
I can't beat you
Can't defeat you
You just make me cry inside
Don't even try to fool me
My rage is growing stronger
And I can't wait no longer
Never learning
Vengeance is burning
Deep inside your mind
Time will come to
When I'll make you
Stumbling like blind leading the blind

I cast my pearls before the swine
Sealed and delivered
Then I drink your toast of wine
Though it's bitter sweet
I'm eating from you hand so neat
Pennies from heaven
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live 
Judas...Judas
Sightseeing through the lights
and shades of you mighty colonnades
No I got the picture
of the beauty and the beast
I am the lamb...you are the priest
To crucify me
To make a living...Makes no difference
Friends, you are what you do
Some are false and some are true
You haven't got a clue
I'd rather reign in hell some said
Than serve in heaven

I was carried to you
By the hands of my fate
Thought it was too late
I wasn't the type that believed in true love
At first sight
you changed it to the right
I know what I feel
This is real
I give you my body and soul
Let your resistance drop
Don't have to stop
By the siren's call
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I'm not the type to believe
in a second chance
Or in sweet romance
I'm no beginner been fooling around before
Still coming back for more
Today is different
It was meant
I've found a reason
There's more than one season
Time to think it over

My one way ride in dead end street
Leading to victory and glory
You seek I hide you'll find defeat
My future's in the hands of fury
You try - but never win
Can't you see I am the demon driver
Don't lie it is a sin
Cuz you know I am the demon driver
I live to drive and never wait
For guardian angels riding by me
To speed or die I'm never late
Wherever you are there will be

Something deep inside, far from reality
We pretend it never crossed our mind
we feel but never sense
Building up a strong defense
Some say it's our destiny, Lord...
We're living on the faultline
Get out of here
Cry the prophets of our time
Fear the signs
Save those you love and all your children
You life depends on castles in the sand
Don't look back there is no promised land
We don't want to hear that this could be the day
So much for science fiction
as you always say
But soon the day will come
It's only just begun
For the people on the faultline
it's no use to pray
Why living in danger
Why living in danger, danger

Can't bow for a rule
Cause I'm nobody's fool
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win
Sometimes I might be rude
Acting in my mood
I'm trying to be straight
Cause I don't want to be late
There's nothing you can say to make
me feel worse than I do (how are you)
You can't buy my freedom
Keep me locked in your cell
Sad how we waste our energy
When all our days are few (makes me blue)
We're two of a kind me and you
I guess that I'll see you in hell
Who is my friend
Who will remain
Seems like I always stand alone in the end
Nobody lasts until the end
You can't buy my life and freedom
It's more than just buy and sell
You can't keep me locked in your cell
See you in hell
