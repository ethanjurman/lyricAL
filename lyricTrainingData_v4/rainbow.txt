I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines that set my hand
Say go, go, go
Beware of a place
A smile of a bright shining face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman
I don't know
She can take you there
The entrance to the fair
Mine, mine, mine
Ride the carousel
And cast a magic spell
You can fly, fly
Tarot woman, well I don't know
Something in the air
Tells me to beware, no, no, no
Her love is like a knife
She'll carve away your life
So go, go, go
Tarot woman, I don't know
Hey, I don't know

In the light of the day
You can hear the old ones say
Was the sound last night the wind?
Can you feel the change begin?
By the fall of the snow
A single soul will go
The footsteps on the white
There's an unholy light
There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go
To run with the wolf
When the world makes a turn
The eyes of one will learn
That a sound just like the wind
Only makes the change begin
By the end of the rain
The feelings passed again
From things that snap and bite
An unholy light
There's a break in the ground
Like the swirling water's angry as they pull you down
When the siren calls you go, yeah
Run with the wolf
Something evil is passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go, yeah
Like a beast in a field
He knows his fate is sealed
He runs with the wolf, oh oooh
See the break, you know it's the same(?)
Now he goes
To run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run
Now we go run, run, run, run
All right

If I'm high on a hill
She'd still been looking down at me
What does she see that brings her closer every day to my heart
If I'm away from home
And think I'm all alone
She's there, somewhere
I look around to see
And looking back at me
She's there, beware!
Creeping like a hungry cat
Seen it before
I know it can mean that
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady starstruck, running after me
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah
I could fly to the moon
But she'd soon find a way to be there
I never knew for a while that a smile made 'em really care
She wants a souvenir
To everyone it's clear
She's hooked - with one look
She wants a photograph
And everybody laughs but not me 'cause I see
She's creeping like a hungry cat
I've seen it before
I know I can mean that
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, oh oh o-o-oh
Oh my
The lady starstruck, running after me, yeah
It used to be a game
Now I can't repeat my name at all
She seems to believe that
I never can refuse a call
She's hooked! With one look!
And everybody laughs, hah!
But not me 'cause I see
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, bad luck
The lady starstruck running after me
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
And back of a tree, looking back at me
Climbing up my stair
I've just got to beware
Lady starstruck, yes, she's bad luck, bad luck

Oh na na na na
Mystery to me is something I can't see
But I see you very well
You're slinky, cool, nobody's fool
But there's something inside I can tell
I know a poor man, a rich man
I know I can talk to a king
But nobody here is gonna tell me
I can't find out one thing
I see a glow around you
Open your arms 'cause I'm walking to you, coming straight or through
Maybe I'm wrong but I know it won't take long to see
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah, yeah
Making sweet love to me, yeah
The logical trend has said I'll know in the end
The things that make you smile
So right from the start, I take an aim at your heart
and know that all the while
I know a rich man, a poor man
I know I can talk to a king, yeah
So nobody here is gonna make me believe
Open your arms 'cause I'm coming, running, straight on through
I could be wrong but I know it won't take long to see
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah
Do you close your eyes, I've gotta know
Do you close your eyes when you making love

High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?
Oh I see his face!
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?
Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky
Hey, I believe, I believe
Too many died
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go
All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand
Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed
In heat and rain
With the whips and chains
We built a tower of stone
But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many died
Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look,
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Time is standing still
He gave back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
The place I've known
But it's not home
Ooh
Take me back
He gave me back my will
Take me back, take me back
Back to my home ooh, ooh, ooh

Can't forget his face
What a lonely place
Has he really let us go?
All the time that's lost
What's the final cost
Will I really get away?
All my life it seems
Just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star
Can't believe it all
Did he really fall
What to do now I don't know
Something's called me back
There's a light in the black
Am I ready to go?
I'm coming home
Breathed the air before
Heard the thunder roar
Never knew it was for me
Always looking down
Lost and never found
Eyes that look but not to see
Like an open door
That you've passed before
But you've never had the key
Something's calling me back
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, yeah
I'm going back to my home
I'm going home, home, home
Going home, home, home
I'm coming back
Don't forget his face
Did he really let us go
What to do now, well I don't know
Like a light in the black
Yes, I'm ready to go
I'm coming home, home, yeah
I've got my way back home
To the sky
There in the sky
I see your star
