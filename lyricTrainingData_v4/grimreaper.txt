What's wrong with our society, is it fear or apathy,
Don't let other people run your life
So those with power don't use it, they simply abuse it,
And believe me that cuts me like a knife

We gotta make sure that this don't happen,
'Cause to me and you it just ain't right,
Gonna make damn sure it don't happen,
This is what I'm gonna do

Rock you to hell, packin' up and shippin' out,
Rock you to hell, hear them scream and shout,
Rock you to hell, but I'm never giving out,
Rock you to hell, Rock you to hell

Did you always do what momma said, brush your teeth and go to bed,
'Cause that way never worked for me,
Now they wanna censor music, and if we don't fight we'll lose it,
It's only entertainment, can't they see?

We gotta make sure that this don't happen,
'Cause to me and you it just ain't right,
Gonna make damn sure it don't happen,
This is what I'm gonna do

Rock you to hell, packin' up and shippin' out,
Rock you to hell, hear them scream and shout,
Rock you to hell, but I'm never giving out,
Rock you to hell, Rock you to hell
Rock you to hell

Is this the beginning of a future
No books, no sound, no rock 'n' roll,
With only a few to fight, the manly
This is why rock 'n' roll will never die

We gotta make sure that this don't happen,
'Cause to me and you it just ain't right,
Gonna make damn sure it don't happen,
This is what I'm gonna do

Rock you to hell, packin' up and shippin' out,
Rock you to hell, hear them scream and shout,
Rock you to hell, but I'm never giving out,
Rock you to hell, Rock you to hell


If you think you're safe at midnight,
That's the last thing you could do,
He'll be looking for that nighttime bite,
He could be coming after you

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire

Look away from his hypnotic eyes,
Or he will put you in a spell
No one hears your last pathetic cries,
Now you live eternal hell

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire

Beware, beware

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire


I left the city for another life, to start it all again,
All I wanted was the solitude, and time to think alone

Peace and quiet seemed the only way, but I guess that
I was wrong,
Now I stand, with gun in hand, I should have known it all along

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

Lust for freedom

I'm imprisoned, shut out from life, but I know it won't be long,
There ain't no way they can keep me in, I will show them that they're wrong,
The lust for freedom will see me through, until I break the chain,
You will never get a second chance, you won't mess with me again

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

I've had enough, ain't taking no more,
The time has come to break the law,
If I give in I'll never get out,
So I must stand, I'm breaking out

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

Lust for freedom


When heaven comes down, look out

They say I'm a loser, and it's tearing me apart,
But I'll show them they're wrong, and believe me I don't fool around
One thing you can bet on is I ain't losing heart,
I'm a fighter, and a fighter like me don't stay down

They'll live to regret it, 'cause my time is coming soon
Don't ask me why but I can feel it in my bones
And when my time comes, I'll be barking at the moon
And then my enemies should never walk alone

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
When heaven comes down, when heaven comes down, look out

All it took was some bad luck, and my friends all let me down,
They lied and they cheated, and took me for a fool
Now I don't trust nobody, and I don't want you around
I'm determined to win, and the winner takes it all

They'll live to regret it, 'cause my time is coming soon
Don't ask me why but I can feel it in my bones
And when my time comes, I'll be barking at the moon
And then my enemies should never walk alone

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
When heaven comes down, when heaven comes down,
When heaven comes down, don't be around

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,


Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die

It's a feeling that I have for music,
It makes me wanna listen every day,
I hope that I will never ever lose it,
That would be a heavy price to pay

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die

If they ever try and take it from me,
I will fight them 'till my dying day,
I know they'll never ever beat me,
I will fight them each and every way

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock me now
All night long
'Till I die

If you wanna rock then follow me,
'Cause that's the way it has to be
We've gotta rock and roll each day,
I don't care what the censors say

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die
Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die


Hey you, Yeah you. Come here,
You gotta problem? Have now, ha

If you're coming to get me, make sure that it's your day,
'Cause if you're not feeling lucky, then pain's the price you'll pay,
If you ever deceive me that's the last thing you'll ever do,
Then I'll come and I'll get you, and they'll never find out who

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

I'm as quick as a rattler, and deadlier than any snake,
And if you talk behind my back then your back's gonna break,
Don't go looking for trouble, it always seems to find me,
I don't know why it happens, but that's the way it seems to be

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

If you wanna fight let's make it now and do it right,
Out on the street in the heat, you're down tonight,
In the neon light prepare to fight, with saving grace,

As I've proved so many times, no one will take my place

Streetwise or not, your time will come to pass one day,
It's the bitter price you will always have to pay
So come on now, or just get out of my sight,
'Cause if you don't, boy, then tonight won't be your night, no way

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born


I'm hitting the street tonight, gotta find a friend,
I just need a guiding light to lead me to the end
And you've been nothing but trouble, I can't take any more,
What do you do when your heart grows cold, no one's really sure

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you took my heart away
Wasted Love - return it back some day
Wasted Love

I'm tired of waiting for you to make up your mind,
You're sitting pretty with your friends from the city,
I'm leaving you behind
But you've got what you wanted, I've gotta find what I need,
No lies, no alibis, for someone to believe

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love

I'm hitting the street tonight, gotta find a friend,
I just need a guiding light to lead me to the end
And you've been nothing but trouble, I can't take any more,
What do you do when your heart grows cold, no one's really sure

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love


Late at night I'm haunted with visions from the past,
They bring back painful memories, how long will they last?
You said you'd always be there, but I fought it on my own,
I guess you made my mind up, 'cause now I walk alone

The bubble's burst, the dream lies broken,
And now I'm out here facing life alone
I guess you took my love for granted,
And now it's turned my broken heart to stone

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want more

Reoccuring nightmare that always come around,
I never will forgive you, you know you let me down,
I lie awake and wonder if I should take the blame,
But it won't make no difference, we'll never be the same

The bubble's burst, the dream lies broken,
And now I'm out here facing life alone
I guess you took my love for granted,
And now it's turned my broken heart to stone

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want more

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want more
