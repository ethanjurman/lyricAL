Where would you be without music
You wouldn't be nowhere it all
You wouldn't be here to invest,oh
If you weren't in heaven no more
One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Well,thank fully we've got the boys
The melody lies fascinated
The rhythm is something divine
Send out a trend of impatience
To see you all movin' so fine
Got to find it soon

Man eatin' momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys
She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
You can take her if you want her you can
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline

Got no silver for my pocket
got no pillow for my head
and the winter it gets stronger
got to ease my aching head
In the morning when I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'm dying
Or I'll got out of my mind
I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my sense reeling
Knowing winter's come to town

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep
She was a cheater
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you
You are a cheater
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go...
This could be or last show
Changing dreams changing schemes... NEVER
We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should I give sorrow, or turn 'round and sneer
I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride
Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall
I can't go on
I, I, I, I...

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open minded,but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said i was there
Lead to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led
Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day,
Is this the way that you get your fun slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun,
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob.
You make me sick getting paid for murder,
But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her.
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds 'cause you won't go to hell.
Take your medal, wear it now with pride.
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside.

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Second to none

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight
Capped everywhere
I've held my licence
It came with birth,
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions
To the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Look around
They're moving in
Hold your ground
When they begin
We can do it
We can do it and if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United we stand one and all
So keep it up
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
[fade]

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
[repeat and fade]

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight
I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance
I'm gonna take
Gonna get out trouble and strife
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise
No I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties
No compromise
Wanna taste what it's like to be free
I'm gonna gather my things
Go through the door
Every night I'll live on my own
I'd like to be there
And I'm gonna be there
I got a will of my own
I go as I please
Fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When I need it
Then I'll ask for advice
[fade]

From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
At every wind what a stake we're in
Is pain better than the grave
When we talk without amend
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike
Kiss of Judas, spider like
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
But you don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm elected protective, detective, Electric Eye!

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light.
Glowin' god of Mars
Body burning bright.
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind.
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power.
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud.
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds.

I've been trying
There's no denying.
It's sending me
Out of my mind.
I've seen reason
Change to treason.
It's losing its sense
Of all kind.
How much longer will it take
For the world to see.
We should learn to live
And simply let it be.
Bloodstone, bloodstone.
In the night time
Wake in fright.
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played.
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made
Bloodstone.
I can't take it.
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that bloodstone.

I move away it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like I thought it would.
Help me, I'm beggin' you please.
You've got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life.
Leave me be.
Take these chains off
Take 'em off of my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave
I tried to run but I'm tied to you like a slave.
It's my fault for loving you so
You were so precious, how could I know.
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me.
I don't owe you anything
Why don't you get out of my life.
Through it all the memories cling
And I can't sleep at night.

I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go.
I've heard the rumours and it seems they're comin' true
do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new.
Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through.
How I suffer for your love.
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried.
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life.
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
You don't know what I like.
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messin' 'round, practice what you preach.
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive

Hey listen don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right.
They're playing at a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear.
Always takin' baby out that's o.k.
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me.
Told you one you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face.
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place.
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace.
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you 'round in the torture before the dread.
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter.
As the sweat is runnin' down your neck
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up.
Oh your heart is pumpin' gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load.
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line.
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake.
I don't talk about it but that's alright
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight.
If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate.

One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud.
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'.
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best.
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.

I'd spend my days alone
I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there.
Like I was in a cell
A captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair.
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control.
Down on the streets below
Bright city lights would glow.
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze
Still counting empty days.
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break the spell.
Fever.  You set my soul on fire.
Fever.  You fill me with desire.
Fever.  You always get it right.
Fever.  All day and all night.
Then one night as I walked
I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar.
Oh how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this.
So destiny has brought us
Oh so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream
At last I'll be with you forever.
And all at once it feels so right.

Hypnotize me
Mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip.
Light my fire
With cold desire
Losing all my grip.
Eat my diamonds
Drinkin' all my gin
Feast your eyes on
A whole lotta sin.
On no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no got your claws stuck in my
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child.
Took my dreams
And now it seems you're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre.
Stop pretendin'
Got me growin' old
Your tormentin's
Fit to snap my soul.
You took my heart
And left it blown to smithereens.
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh
And drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed.
Goin' under
Hear the thunder
Death defying grace.
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face.
Vivious talkin'
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised, so abused
I'm a human sacrifice.

When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you.
You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You Pulled me back to earth
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future
Will you ever set me free
Take me into your arms again
In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain.

Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in
Never stops the Way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
You'll find there's life with victory
With victory on high
Freewheel burning [x8]

Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode - Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down
Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
All your life
Tough as steel
Stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
All your life...

Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figure's primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemned to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives
Now facing one another
The stand-off eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown

When you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise
That's when I crawl
Gliding on mist
Hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss
Evils abound
In the dead of night
Love bites
Into your room
Where in deep sleep
There you lie still
To you I creep
Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend
You smile as I sip
Now you are mine
In my control
One taste of your life
And I own your soul
Softly you stir
Gently you moan
Lust's in the air
Wake as I groan
Love bites you
Invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you
Delights you
It drains you to white
You knew at first sight
You'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite
There'd be no turning back
So come in my arms
I strike any hour
I will return
To trap and devour
Love bites...

Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
And eat me alive
Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver as
You give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as
The rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive

You can look to the left and look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights-flashing colors
Sleepless nights...
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks who are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
And slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day burning hell fire
You're blown away...
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
And the man with the power
No! No! ...

In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days (yeah)
That's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
And there's nowhere to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Then I will wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
And there's no place to go
Oh no!
You won't be there tomorrow
Say it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
And there's no place to go...

I know you like it hot
Love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside ya till the power splits your head
We're gonna rock ya till your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with an iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
So come on let's tell the world

Why do I have to wait so long
Before you come into my life again
Seems as though forever until
I can be here by your side till then
I think you feel the same way too
You know you make my dreams come true
If you'll just turn on your light
Let me see it shining through the night
When I'm far away from here
I'll hold all the memories so clear
If I only have the choice
I would stay so let me hear your voice

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one

When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimensions
It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling
Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings
Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision
An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
Your gonna get richer, I gotta get wild
Any time you want to
Any way you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Live that fantasy
I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane late at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light
You know where we're going
I know where we are
Set the rear view mirror for the backseat of the car
In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you
When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotised
Never seen nothin' like it no,
You won't believe your eyes
Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean
Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling to the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar
Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound
Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night
Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on
Do you love it loud

Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more the pain you'll feel
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice
Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
so expect the worst
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry, is victory, is victory

As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting
Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice
Not begging you
I'm telling you
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night
They're closing in
They'll never win
You won't make me,
As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down
just I'll face you under
Hands of justice
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear

The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me
And carved out of stone
I've broken hearts
Made people sing
I've drove a million miles
I've done everything
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
And no one can take that away
Bring on the night
That's when I live
I come alive inside
Give all I can give
I live each day
Like it's my last
I live for rock and roll
I never look back
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

Wouldn't change it even if I could

You get me up, then we both get down
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds
I'm all tied up on your bed
I'd rather be inside your head
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back
Then you ease off with your attack
You're the best I've had if you please
You never stop, you great big tease
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show

It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all
corners of the land
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of
hand
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Impossible to stop
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in
awe
At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for
And millions roared, and millions cheered
This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore en-captured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Pain! Pain!
Killer! Killer!
Can't stop the Painkiller!
Pain!

Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road
Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol
Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground
Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you
Crome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All Guns, All Guns Blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
With a burning heart
Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
No-one survives
Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground
High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing lazer
Burning glaze
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud
It's comin' - Meltdown
Start runnin' - Countdown

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Force rises
False rituals
Baptises
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
The burning sermons consecrate their sin

You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
You're possessing me
In the night please set me free
I can't resist your Touch of Evil
A Touch of Evil
Touch

Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins
Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see
This day will last forever
Deep in the hearts of men
Courage and victory
Remember, remember
One Shot At Glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire
Fighting on with dignity
In life and death we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel
I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
