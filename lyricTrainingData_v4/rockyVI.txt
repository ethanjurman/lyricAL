Two worlds collide
Rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope
Against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up
Against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West
Or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart
In the warrior's code
There's no surrender
Though his body says stop
His spirit cries, never
Deep in our soul
A quiet ember
Knows it's you against you
It's the paradox
That drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart

Silent darkness creeps into your soul
And removes the light of self-control
The cave that holds you captive has no doors
Burnin' with determination
To even up the score
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's rising high
The moment of truth draws near
Time will not allow you to stand still, no
Silence breaks the heart and bends the will
And things that give deep passions are your sword
Rules and regulations have no meaning anymore
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's rising high
The moment of truth is here
Is here
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's rising high
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's rising high
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within

Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
Rising up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
Just a man and his will to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger

We're not indestructible
Baby, better get that straight
I think it's unbelievable
How you give into the hands of fate
Some things are worth fighting for
Some feelings never die
I'm not askin' for another chance
I just wanna know why
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in can't be wrong
I don't wanna pacify you
I don't wanna drag you down
But I'm feelin' like a prisoner
Like a stranger in a no named town
I see all the angry faces
Afraid that could be you and me
Talkin' about what might have been
I'm thinkin' about what it used to be
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in can't be wrong
Baby, baby, we can shed this skin
We can know how we feel inside
Instead of goin' down an endless road
Not knowin' if we're dead or alive
Some things are worth fightin' for
Some feelings never die
I'm not askin' for another chance
I just wanna know why
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in, givin' in can't be wrong, no
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home

would never change your mind
I'm sure you don't know but to me you seem so unkind
I don't [Incomprehensible] sympathy
I just want a chance to get you closer to me
I feel I'm on a, one way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
Surrender by voices, I don't want to hear
I tell myself that must be insincere
I never told you lies
He was the one who put the tears in you eyes
I feel I'm on a, one way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
Spend your whole life waiting for a sign
You make your move too late and love gets left behind
Truth is never, you don't want to see
I may falling, take advantage of me, take it from me
I don't care who is right or who is wrong
One day our loneliness is a day too long
You only may wanna stay
Second time 'round our heart is harder to brake, harder to break
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection

Deepest cut that can be healed
By the gun or by the sword
It's hope that you can turn yourself
Outside at the end of the war
The cold sweat sticks to your heart
Your mouth gets drier and drier
The battle inside rages on
Your pulse races higher and higher
Sweetest victory, I love you more than life itself
Sweetest victory, you give me strength to know myself
Oh, sweet victory, my soul is yours and the glory is mine
Sweetest victory, the far-off stars will always shine
The toothlike nails rip me up
I can make it disappear
Time to forget has passed me by
There's no place to hide my fear
Hate and pain filled me up
Every minute takes longer and longer
I bead of sweat 'cause drops of blood
Make me stronger and stronger
Sweetest victory, I love you more than life itself
Sweetest victory, you give me strength to know myself
Oh, sweet victory, my soul is yours and the glory is mine
Sweetest victory, the far-off stars will always shine
The cold sweat sticks to your heart
Your mouth gets drier and drier
The battle inside rages on
Your pulse races higher and higher
I love you more than life itself
You give me strength to know myself
Sweetest victory
Sweetest victory
Sweetest victory, I love you more than life itself
Sweetest victory, you give me strength to know myself
Oh, sweet victory, my soul is yours and the glory is mine
Sweetest victory, the far-off stars will always shine
Sweetest victory, Sweetest victory, Sweetest victory, Sweetest victory
