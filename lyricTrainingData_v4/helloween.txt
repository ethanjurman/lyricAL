Much too long, I've been a prisoner here
The hour has come to break out
Shackled and chained, almost goin' insane
It's better to live on the run
Set me free, set me free
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
I have to think for myself and then act
In conformity of my own thoughts
No one should tell what's wrong and what's right
Why don't you leave me alone?
Set me free
Give me wings to fly
Ride on!

Coming from the sewerage, creepin' through the pipes
Born from modern chemistry, a thing that is alive
Growing in this rotten crap at places no one wipes
Eating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thrive
The scientists got no way to fight
For they can't find any weak point to get rid of it right
You live your life and you don't know what's goin' on
You just can't stop a-thinking that the officials do you wrong
You're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's arm
And the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harm
Even thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the door
Frustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whore
You won't believe till you know that it's real
From the pain in your stomach and the horror you feel
You need a shit, so you head off for the loo
You're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do!
There's the reptile (reptile)
Just see his eyes
Reptile (reptile)
Can you see the beast arise?
Creeping up on you
There's nothing left that you can do
And there's the reptile (reptile)
Hidden till now
But now it's there; you don't know how
Just watch it grow
And there's no more human being left but you
You
Oh, yeah!

We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axis
Of our minds without love without hate
We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers, we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string
Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them, we might all fail
We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show
There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been
With new minds made so clean
They will be the saints
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Take care eternally
Puppets on a string

There are phantoms here on earth who take away our lives
They kill your kids and they rape your wives
They rip your flesh, tear your heart, take you down to hell
They don't give a damn on any kind of life
Phantoms bring evil, destruction, and death
Night after night, the same old game
They all look so harmless, but deep in their hearts
Satan is lurking, and he will break out
Always someone at your back
Only waiting to attack
Phantoms of death
The empire of deceivers is built upon your fear
You'll have to lose it, 'cause the end is near
Warheads, armies stand to strike; I know it isn't right
I wanna get out of here; I don't wanna die
Infernal destruction; in fire, you'll burn
Then you'll be helpless, but it's not too late
Stand up right now and you'll be the winner
Or Satan will get you, take you forever
Genocide everywhere
Where's the savior of this world?
Where is he, the promised savior? The one who'll save the earth
Perhaps he'll come to bury us, but then it'll be too late
Who are they? Who are the phantoms who will end our lives?
It's you and me, you and me; open up our eyes
We are all parasites of this world
We shall die

Full moon, standing in the streets
I know the time is near
Incarnate power roaring from the sky
Unrelenting forces blasting through the air
Roaring thunder, lift your hands and pray
Running through the empty streets
They're looking for the fight
Swords gleam in the light of moon
The gods prepare to strike
Metal invaders, ready to strike
A warning from hell, be careful tonight
All right!
Dark night overwhelming bright light
See the demons fly
Can't trust your senses; fear you'll have to die
Super mighty shadows casting amplitudes to ears
Sounds you've never heard that take you high
Time has come for them to rise
Invasion is their doom
Riding high on iron horses
In the light of moon
Metal invaders, the gods on their ride
Sworn to bring metal, mayhem tonight
Tonight!
Tonight...

You're runnin' around in the gamblin' hall
Every night, it's the same
You're lookin' for something new to play
To win and have fun is your aim
A pinball speaks to you
His metal voice is knockin' in your head
You can't resist; you'll have to play
You're just another victim caught in the trap
Gorgar will eat you
Gorgar—man, you'll never win—hey
Gorgar—but you keep on playin'—hey
Your blood is boilin'; your eyes grow wide
Advance—too late
Gamblin' fever has taken your mind
This fuckin' machine, oh, hate
You spend all your money
But you'll never win
You're always the loser
And the robot's voice keeps hammering
Wastin' money for fun every night
Livin' for today, no thoughts for tomorrow
Man, you are dead, don't you realize?
Wake up and live before it's too late
Too late!
Gorgar—but you keep on playin'
Tilt

Fight hard
Live fast
Play loud
Step out of the crowd
Iron
Rulin'
Steel bent
Forever, the faith will live on in our hearts
There's nothing else in all the world
That will bring it down
We will play our wildest step to all around
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood
Power
Burnin'
Brains out
United metallians ready to strike
White heat
Red hot
Mayhem
If you don't feel it, you won't understand
Heavy Metal is the law that keeps us all united free
A law that shatters earth and hell
Heavy Metal can't be beaten by any dynasty
We're all wizards fightin' with our spell

A lot of things occur each day
We've got to live with on our way
There's so much misery on the screen
With commercials in between
And the Russians won't be so late
Uncle Sam don't wanna wait
No matter if you're black or white
You never, ever had a right
And look up to the eternal skies
See warfare even there
What once has been a paradise
Now destruction and despair
In other worlds, the children die
Lacking food, ill from a fly
Oppressed by troops to tame their land
It's all the same again
If any man is free on earth
Then tormentors steal his birth
They slam gun butts in his face
And leave his woman choked in mace
So, stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise your voice, pass on the light
Unite! It's not too late
How many tears flow away
To become a sea of fears?
How many hearts are torn apart
Till another torment starts?
But before the world
Turns into a sun
All cruelty and violence
On earth will be dead and gone

You, you say, you have lost the way
Got no aim, just livin' for today
Look up to the sky above
And see the morning sun again
You got so much power inside
So cry it out my friend
I'm alive, I'm alive
There's no use in hangin' all around
You're a king, can't you see your crown
Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
You just need a friend
Together we will sing along
I'm alive

Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground
Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I want to do so much in my way"
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burning so hot in my head
We got
A little time to build up our lives
A little time to make up our minds
A little time to fill up our dreams
A little time, time

Insania, 204
We've thrown away our former Gods
Controlling our day
We have created better ones
So we control the way
We are the ones with the power
To hold down the enemy
Our Gods are perfection
And they are protecting our lives
We still need some more of them
To be safe from the other side
As long as we're stronger
Nothing will happen to us
Fire flash in the night
Just an evil dream
Holy war in the sky
Never
Insania, 2016
Error in store 103
We watch the sun at night
The pretty Gods we've built ourselves
Now terminate our lives
Silicone brain, powered voices
Are crying attack tonight
Our Gods are now fighting
In anger, burning our world
Doomsday has come
And there is no place to hide away
The future is over
And there is no turning back
Now reality
Twilight of the Gods
Insania's dead and gone
Another world was born
But the twilight soon will come

Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid it's breakin' twice
Thanks to you, my dear old friend
But you can't help, this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I won't have no sleep tonight
In my heart, in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong, young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
It's alright, we'll stay friends
Trustin' in my confidence
And let's say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight
With my heart, with my soul
Some guys cry, you've bought and sold
They've been strong, young and bold
And they say, play this song again

If you're out there all alone
And you don't know where to go to
Come and take a trip with me to Future World
And if you're running through your life
And you don't know what the sense is
Come and look how it could be, in Future World
We all live in happiness our life is full of joy
We say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side
We love our life and we know we will stay
'Cause we all live in Future World
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious
Come with me - Future World
You say you'd like to stay
But this is not your time
Go back, find your own way to Future World
Life can be for living
Just try and never give in
Tell everyone the way to Future World
One day you'll live in happiness
With a heart that's full of joy
You'll say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness will be at your side
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why
Scream it out
We all live in Future World
Come with me
Future World
Future World!

Masquerade, masquerade
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out well disguised
Heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat, they have no choice
Little ghosts are making lots of noise
But watch out (watch out)
Beware
Listen (listen)
And take care
In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's Hell or paradise
It's Halloween
Tonight
Someone's sitting in a field
Never giving yield
Sitting there with gleaming eyes
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie
Well, watch out (watch out)
Listen now, we are calling you
Listen tonight, we are calling you
And there is magic in the air
Magic in the air
On Halloween
Black is night, full of fright
You'll be missing day
What will be here very soon?
Changing your way
A knock at your door
Is it real or is it a dream?
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream on Halloween, on Halloween
Darkness, where am I now?
Is there anybody out there?
What has happened?
Am I in Heaven or is it Hell?
I can see a light come
It's coming nearer, it's shining
It's shines so bright
It's shining on me
I am the one
Doom's in my hands
Now, make your choice
Redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man
Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind
Deliverance and peace of mind
But watch out, watch out, beware
Listen, listen, take care
Yeah, it's Halloween

People are in big confusion
They don't like their constitutions
Every day, they draw conclusions
And they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective
Some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective
Well, your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care about what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free, let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind, follow the sign
Together we fly someday
Hey, we think so supersonic
And we make our bombs atomic
Or the better, quite neutronic
But the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays, the air's polluted
Ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed
To create a better time
Forever we fly
Together we fly
Forever we fly someday
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoooooaaaaaaa...

When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back
There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before
When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
The life I try to give is
All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone
Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
See his strong hands
But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
See the drunk man, try to ask him why
He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
There's a fight in his head he cannot win
Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin
You... you cannot hide
You... you cannot describe your feelings inside

Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
Everyone could see him fall
And be sure it's been his last hit
He's never been seen at all
Some dictator felt progressive
And lay down in the sun
But his people were aggressive
They killed him with a gun
Sometimes you're wrong
By some things you have done
You see fate is too strong
Nothing's won
No use for a fight
If you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size
Like a lie
It's the rise and fall
The prize for all
That ain't nice at all
Luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain
A little dragon could spit fire
But never so for something bad
He didn't know the knight's desire
To throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet
Their parents told them "Stop"
Then it all turned out peculiar
He couldn't get it up
And it's all in vain
When you're living with pain
Reap not goods you have grown
By your own
Feelings you like
Disappear overnight
You sip up every grin
Free to win
You nearly go insane
A spaceman flies the rocket
That takes him to the stars
Thinks his wife is in his pocket
But she's strolling 'round in bars
The king of Los Angeles
Bought himself a teddy bear
And the queen became shameless
She did it with a chair

Once they killed his monster
When he went into a trap
Now, he's making better ones
On a higher step
On a warm summer day
The doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now, his hips are aching, what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right
Time is right
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers
And they do it their own way
They mix some DNA
Some skin and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Helloween
They become great politicians
One night, he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought
Well, never mind
Took a syringe and blew out his life
They become a great possession
They become a great oppression
Time is right, time is right, time is right

Don't turn your head
Back to the wall
Don't close your eyes
And wait for your fall
If you believe that you know in this time
You've got anything to win
If you believe that you know
Then I say, "you'll lose all again"
In this time there's nothing to get for you
You cannot really do what you want
You're a child, a prisoner in your mind
You are a victim of this hopeless time
You better believe all you do has a sense
It's not for nothing
You better believe all the troubles you have
Will play you someday
Why don't you help yourself and do the best
Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
Why don't you stand up to say who you are
To show the people that paradise is not far
Oh, can't you see we got the right
To look into the future without no need to hide
No, we won't accept what you do
We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
To say we are here to see the light
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can
We are credulous idiots
And won't understand what they plan
We march with the times
It's what they expect and we do
Why don't you open your eyes
To undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
Go oppose with your fist
Fight for your rights

Too late to call for the priest
He is not here anymore
We look at the age of the beast
And we've seen its vast armies form, hear our call
Please, save us, please, save us
In permanent madness we live
No time for life and for love
To take is the rule, not to give
Insanity comes from below to take us all
We believe that the phenomena of nature
Are the expression of infinitive intelligence
We express our belief that all forms of life
Are manifestations of spirit
And thus, all men are children of God
Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
Waiting for his future and the final call
We stand on the edge of the world
Just one step more and we fall
Guide us and please take our hands
Without You were weak and alone, hear our call
Please, save us, please, save us now
Save us from the gods of thunder
Save us from the dogs of war
Save us from the creeping nightmares
Save us from the evils course
Save us from our own ignorance
Save us from the man in black
Save us from the desolation
Save us from the hate attack
Save us, oh, please
Save us, oh, please, save us
Save us now

Hours of lust, hours of tears
Passing by before my eyes
Today, tomorrow, yesterday, one life
Days of joy, day of sadness
Come and go to pass me by
A month, a year, one hundred years
They fly
One day I will be gone
To lead another life
And this world will stop
To turn around with me
Cause time marches
Time marches on without us all
Never stops, yes
Time marches
Time marches on and on and on
Flies eternally
Times of peace, times of fights
Constant movement is our life
Can't stop no more, not until we die
We long for more
Eternity and maybe there's another life
This one is short, no matter how you try
But never give up
All the hope to lead a good life
No, don't waste your given time
To make things worse
Please, please help me see
The best way to be
Make a change and we live eternally
No more wasted years
No more wasted tears
Life's too short to cry
Long enough to try

From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No-one asks us how we'd like to be
In school they teach us what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
At a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this
I want out
To live my life alone
Leave me be
To do things on my own
To live my life and to be free
People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
Cause I decide the way things gonna be
There's a million ways (million ways) to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool (million ways)
In the end of it, (in the end) none of us is right
Sometimes, we need to be alone (alone, alone, alone)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave me alone

Make the people hold each other's hands
And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind
So do as divined
Put on your armour, ragged after fights
Hold up your sword
You're leaving the line
Make yourself ready for the lords of the dark
They watch your way
So be cautious, quiet and hark
You hear them whispering in the crowns of the trees
You're whirling round, but your eyes don't agree
Will-o'-the-wisps misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse
Without taking their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us be
Kill that Satan who won't let us begin
You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from Demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat running down your neck
And the dwarves of falseness throw mud at your back
Guided by spells from the old seer's hand
You're suffering pain only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust, heat and sway
Throw the first key into the sea of hate
Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belonged into the sea of greed
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Throw the key or you may die
On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He's sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He's playing you on with delight
Man, who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven scars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be
Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key, throw the key
Throw the key
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming and earth swallowing him away
You've locked up the seven seas
And the seer of visions can now rest in peace
There ain't no more Demons and no more disease
And mankind live up, you're free again
Yes, the tyrant is dead
He is gone, overthrown
You have given our souls back to light
