Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law
I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive
So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight
Oh, I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha!)
I can howl at the rain (Ow!)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains
Love me tonight

Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Oh!
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!
I shall return from out of the... (Fire!)

Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
Oh, I'm running free
I spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free
Get out of my way, hey
Right?
Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah!
Oh
I'm running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah, yeah!
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah
Running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) yeah
Ow, ow! Ow, ow!

I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
Torture me back at your lair

The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh
Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old
Oh, baby
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a "fiver", it's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?
Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well, Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'Cause you're making love all day
Aw, 'cause you're making
Ooh
Ooh yeah

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought
Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
Just come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
I'm a wrathchild
Ah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh... yeah!
Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah!

I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Flee before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy
I'm running from the Gendarmes
I'm never coming home
Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of
Running from the arms of the law
Running from the Gendarmes
It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that inside my mind
Well, I've got to say I've done it before
They're never gonna find me
I'm never going home

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began
I'm running away, nowhere to go
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know. Yeah
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah

Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ooh, look out!
You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me
I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oh yeah, I've done it again!
Yeah!
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you!
Aha ha ha ha!
Oh! Oh!

Listen to me, Lamia, listen to what I've got to say
I've got these feelings and they won't go away
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees
Oh, help me, Lamia, or I'm sure I'll die, oh, please
I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be
I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please
Oh, Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh

Thinking of an age old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Is it me, I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led
Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!
Forever now, I can't think why
Or is it me, I just don't know
When you see me walking up beside you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away!

She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form
It's been three long years since I've been gone
I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
I'll never know the reason why I had to go
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?
I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone
Oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?

Walk away, yeah!
Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
Sitting here, think it's gonna be a new day
Gonna get my song and I can't go wrong
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song
What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song
Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh hoo
Ooh yeah
I keep on drifting
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah
I'm gonna sing my song, yeah
And it won't take long
I want you to sing along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
'Cause I'm a drifter
Drifting on
Yeah!

Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around
So be prepared – don't run – stand your ground
They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders... Pillaging!
Invaders... Looting!
Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders... Fighting!
Invaders... Marauding!
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle-weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
Invaders... Raping!
Invaders... Plundering!

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the Damned
He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought, "Oblivion? Well, it beckons us all."
Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?
Oh-o-o-o-o-ooh
You're children of the Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight

We want information, information, information
Who are you?
The new number 2
Who is number 1?
You are number 6
I am not a number, I am a free man!
I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feet
Goin' all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going – out!
If you kill me, it's self-defense
But if I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid of when I call out your name
Run, fight to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don't
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me

Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty six
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah!
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
666 the one for you and me
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?
A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail
Dead men, gangland
Murder, gangland
Tell no tales

Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who wasted her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice
Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Numbing our desires
Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
"Is this the end?" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm
Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun

I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God why has He let me go?
As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare

"O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride"
Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips
The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn
Go
Bind all of us together
Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
Still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you

As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God, my father, I fly"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave
Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
Fly

Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
If you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
13, the beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise
Terror, death, destruction
Pour from the eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands
They died, with their boots on
Yes, they died
They died, they died, with their boots on
We died, we died, we died, we died, we died

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

What ho said the t'ing with the three bonce, don't meddle with things you don't understand
Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me
Oh I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane
I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do
Oh they drain my strength away
Oh they're asking me to stay
Nightmares. Spirits calling me
Nightmares. They won't leave me be
All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool
Now I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear
Nightmares. Coming all the time
Nightmares. Will give me peace of mind
Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too
Oh we'll drown together
It will be forever
Nightmares. Forever calling me
Nightmares. Now we rest in peace

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Discovery of man
And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat
They searched all across the land

Well, you killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct, Animal supreme
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last – nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade and break you both
In two – break you both in two
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on
And it's rolling still

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it that you would die
In the desert the planet Dune
Without a still suit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the 'mice'
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'
He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars
The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down
You'll see he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men
And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
He'll make a stand
Against evil the fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout "Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers."
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun
Midnight
It's all night

As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men

He threw down a glove, you made the mistake
Of picking it up, now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance
Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Fight for your life
Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow
The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile, the reaper looks on
Oh, oh, fought for the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought for the pleasure
Fought to the death

Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole, and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Tables start to burn
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
But still, we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name!
Back in the village
I'm back in the village

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Slave to the Power of Death

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Slave to the Power of Death

If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?
Time is always on my side
Can I tempt you, come with me
Be Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go, would you be scared?
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be honestly
Just let yourself go
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong
Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally... let yourself go!
Caught now in two minds!

From the coast of gold across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
Out in the night somebody's crying
Of madness

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying, I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare
Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided
Oh oh
My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take
Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on
Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone and men again
They came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone
Trapped inside this prison

When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?
When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?
'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like I've been here before
Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before?
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged
'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

"My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee"
Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander
At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Became a legend amongst mortal men
King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia
Became a god amongst mortal men
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
He died of fever in Babylon

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die
One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep
Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end?
In Heaven or in Hell?
Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams
There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again

Can I play with madness?
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
There's no vision there at all
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)
He said:
He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see
I screamed aloud to the old man
I said "Don't lie, don't say you don't know"
I say "You'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next"
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said "You wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
"Listen to me," said the prophet

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn
You know, you know
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do

Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds
Seventh son of a seventh son
Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil, which path will he take?
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late
Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman, the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me?
Is it so hard to understand?
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends
Suffering and pain, impending disaster
Souls crying, the Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits
I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me
Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?
Purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, Hell awaits
I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late

Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?
I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
...and be reborn again?

The demon in your mind will tear you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
My fate is sealed
If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath
Your time will come
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
Brothers and their fathers joining hands to make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel
I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son

Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home
Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your soul to this brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world
Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt
There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted, which are you?
Diablo, come again
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus snap in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will, iron fist
How could it have come to this?

Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now? Is it really happening?
Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination?
I just can't take no more
The dream is true, the dream is true
Think I've heard your voice before
Think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
Coming to the realisation
That I can't see for sure
I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
To save me from myself
I get up, put on the light
Dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep myself from drifting
Saving me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost, a nightmare I retrace
Lost, a hell that I revisit
Lost, another time and place
Lost, a parallel existence

Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a Devil to get ready and take over your mind
You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the only one
I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
Beaten, fallen Angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no-one knows
Nomad, where you go to no-one tells
Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No-one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told
No-one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no-one's seen you kill
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius
Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
No man ever understood your genius
Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no-one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Withered hands, withered bodies
Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty
The punishment is death for all who live
Dreams of desolation
Come the Demons of creation
The killing fields, the grinding wheels
Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you
Before you know the crime, it's all too late

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
The thin line between love and hate

I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go
And I just feel I can be anything
That all I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I wanna be
Make my wildest dreams come true
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
Out on the road again
When I remember back to how that
Things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell
When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be
I'm gonna break away
I'm out on my own
Breaking away

When I was wandering in the desert
I was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives
Like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
To wash the tears
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away

There's a darkened sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me
Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me
A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No-one can stop me now
Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait till then
No more lies!
They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
But there's more things I have to do
Don't tell me that this is the end

I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocents, evil took place
The angels were burning inside
Centuries later I wonder why
What secret that they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion still burning inside
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free
The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan his weapon is lust
Living this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of life
The perfect would willingly have died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of god they had claimed
Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars and to die and be free

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me
And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures – they were undead – all of them
They had ascended from hell
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Have a drink and say a prayer for it
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead

Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights
To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead

Bleeding you dry from the start
The sum of my parts
To give it away
New life in a day
Some new Frankenstein
Damned for all time
Cursed by the angel who fell
Who saves me from Hell?
And who is my god?
And where is my soul?
Too tired to jump, too young to run
Never-ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man
I want to end my life now
But I don't know how
Recycled again, a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The Devil has planned

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years
Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon
Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
But the war, no chance to live again
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go
Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale
Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go
Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat
See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale

Everybody's waiting for something to happen
Everybody's waiting for something to see
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters
Everyone's waiting for news on TV
Winding lives at the end of the spiral
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill
Everyone's looking but no-one is listening
Everybody wants to be in at the kill
I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end of time
Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing
Everyone's looking for the reason why
Everyone's hoping for life ever after
Everyone's looking at death from the sky
Everyone's nightmares are going to happen
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes
Everyone's praying but no-one's believing
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies
I see the signs of the end
So I watch and I wait and I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all
And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war
So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low
You can't protect yourselves, even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals, they laugh right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace
Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore
And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
But the memory still remains
All the past years, not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun
Spare your life and you choose the destruction of time over yourself
Yeah!
