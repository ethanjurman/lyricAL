It's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all
Stand up and shout
Let it out
You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again
You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire, go on, explode

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies
Life's a never-ending wheel, say
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah!
Oh what's becoming of me? No! No!
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy Diver, sole survivor
You're the one who's clean
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you, Holy Diver
Oh Holy Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Hmm hmm hmm

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white
Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail
You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy
Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin
So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right
So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Flying away in the clouds
You know you're losing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow
You can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle

Don't talk to strangers
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down
Hey, you, you know me
You can touch me I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see
Can you feel me?
I'm danger, I'm the stranger
And I, I'm darkness
I'm anger, I'm pain
I, I'm the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away, go
No, no, don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down yeah
Run, run, run, run away

Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all
Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel
And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found
Oh here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one never told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no
But here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
In the middle of the heart
Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right through your heart
And here it comes, here it comes again
Straight through the heart

If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there
She had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And in the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down
It said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away
He was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in mama's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said
You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible
Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and then I took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door
So I go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible
Go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible
I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
Disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me, you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I, we're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear
It calling you beware
Look out
There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark, whoa oh oh

Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
All right
And shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
And I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say, oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh Lord, just go the way you came again
Oh, shame on the night
So I know I'd better run
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh, shame on the night
Here I go, I've got to run
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Well, I lost my hold on the magic flame
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
[evil laughter fading]

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind can penetrate your mind
But sail on, sing your song, carry on
Cause we rock, we rock
We rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices, all giving choices
If we listen, they will say, oh we can find the way
But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
We rock, we rock
Sail on, sing your song, carry on
Ride out, stand and shout, carry on
See how we rock
We rock, that's rock

We're the ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness
That it needs, yeah
We're a laugh without tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming, home
We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never, come home
But the magic that we'll feel
Is worth the lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down
We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
Then quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line
Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies
Between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase
Is worth the pain
We're the last in line, oh
Yeah, we're off to the witch
We may never, never, never come home
Is worth a lifetime
You know we're the throw before the toss
But the only way to go is down
See how we shine
We're the last in
We're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're the laugh without tear
We're the smile without the mirror

You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
'Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn
You're breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, willing to learn

Alright
Dark touches, send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure
I hate the light
I speed at night
At night
Alright!
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've got some stairs to heaven
You may be right
I only know in my world
You've got some stairs to heaven you may be right
I speed at night yeah!
I speed at night night night night night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
I speed at night alright

Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But riders in the night
Can lift you out of sight when they call
That's all
My Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
Then someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
There's no day, no way
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come, steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch?
Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm the poor, I'm the sure
I'm the holy, I'm the pure
I can tell you tales
You just might not believe
One night, one night
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play for
One night touching pretty
But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light
One night
One night feeling pretty
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty in the city
One child went away
And one child stayed to play
Chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up
Where they fall, in the city

Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know, no, no
It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, they'll see you anyway
Evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, evil eyes
They'll follow forever
'Cause they're evil eyes
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes

Can you hear me?
Can you see there's a storm
On the edge of the sky?
Does it matter?
Well, it does to me
And I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder
There should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no-one sees
There is only the dark
Just imagine, will you try?
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine
Not what you want to see

Well, it's been a long hot road I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there, no, no
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light, all right
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out
You've been hungry all of your life, yeah
We speed across emotion
And then we lose our hold
We turn on wheels of passion
That we can't control
So eat your heart out
Run to the shadows and hide
All on fire then he dies, then he dies, then he dies

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine
Then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew
That the chains were on
My, my, my
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand
As it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me
And that's free but still
Your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still, your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
Oh my, the chains were on
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still, the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still, her chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on
The chains were on, the chains were on
Yeah, the chains were on
Seen them walking on the water
The chains were on
Seen them flying through the sky
My, the chains were on
Yes, the chains were on

Oh running into nowhere turning like a wheel and a year becomes a day
Whenever we dream that's when we fly so here is a dream for just you and I
We'll fin the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heart
Oh here we see the wizard staring through the glass and he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie and the things you've got to do yeah
Oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
But oh sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night oh look to the light
Well you fight to kill the dragon and bargain with the beast and sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow and never leave the ground and still you don't know why
Whenever you dream you're holding the key it opens the door to let you be free yeah
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heart
A shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack and he's looking right at you quick
Run along the rainbow before it turns to black attack
And oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
Oh sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart yeah bleeding in the night yeah yeah 
We'll find the sacred heart

She's a rumor in the night it's crazy you can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light it's crazy but you go anywhere
It was just a summer night maybe when a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away maybe to go where where where
She crouches the hunter ready to tell you another lie another lie
You could see the side of someday feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway you were wrong wrong wrong
She jumped at the moment a chance to tell you another lie another lie another lie

You look and you know she's telling you another lie another lie another lie
Why it's crazy when you feel you're getting stronger another lie
Why it's crazy all the lies are getting longer another lie
Who oh yeah another lie another lie

It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door
She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar
The devil of one another
Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody broke a heart
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Without a friend
But they got Rock 'N' Roll
On the night that they cried forever

Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman oh oh oh
Anybody can anybody can sunset superman oh oh oh 

There's perfect harmony in the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness hunted by the lion and the lamb ah ah ah ah
We bring you fantasy we bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle or we will disappear never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away sailed away
We bring you beautiful we teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe or we will disappear never to return again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away they sailed away sailed away
And as we drift along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle and a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds and then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness just lost like them and part of all the pain that they feel yeah
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away leaving nothing nothing more to say all the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful and they'll always let you in
But doors are never open to the child without a trace of sin sail away

Two faces on fire no traces something has swallowed the night you know that nothing can make it all right yeah
Like candy emotion too much and sugar can turn to sand you scream but nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain or do we see just what we are we're naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children guns loaded take aim and blow all the dreams away too late for anything better to say hey
Are we just crazy with the pain or do we see just what we are we are 
Naked in the rain naked in the rain maked in the rain
Two faces no fire no traces fever has turned to snow hearts break to show you the way as you go oh
Are we just running from the pain or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children on fire emotion burns higher guns loaded blow all the dreams away
Naked in the rain naked in the rain frightened by the pain naked in the rain

Seems like heard this song at least a thousand times before 
He just wanted her but she wants more so build a wall keep it all to herself oh oh
Always never seemed to be too much reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains sad remains another victim of overlove overlove
He was just the devil in a thing disquise jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page close the cage on another victim of overlove
Overlove yeah overlove overlove overlove overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone and come the dawn you got another victim of overlove
Overlove overlove overlove love love love love overlove

Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back and everytime there's sunshine I'm blind yeah
I am everybody and everyone that I know is me everyone that I know won't see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer yeah
I'm another number and you know the numbers must agree but everytime the wind blows I can't fly why
We take away tomorrow and never see the end of today lock it up and send it away forever
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star 
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are I could have been a dreamer oh oh
Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back but maybe that was sunshine that I saw
I've heard about a rainbow I've heard it makes you crazy I think I'm goin' crazy crazy 'cause I see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer I could have been the one to fly
I always could have been a dreamer 'cause dreamers never die no
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer dreamer
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer

Give me shelter shelter I can face the day then I'll just fade away give me shelter give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly the fire starts to die you open up your eyes 
Faces in the window noises in the night
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window
We are evil and we are all divine creations of the mind we are pleasure
I see clearly who's behind the wall yes I can see us all
We're faces in the window noises in the night
Give me shelter shelter shelter give me shelter shelter shelter
Faces in the window noises in the night faces in the window hiding from the light
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window
When the fire starts to die and you open up your eyes there they are in the window faces in the window
We are evil and divine just creations of the mind and faces in the window faces in the window

Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move they're shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire burning through your brain turn to face the train oh oh
Hey it's magic said the mother to the child it's stronger than a smile let it go
When a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah when a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah
Just when you think it's pretend here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever maybe we'll still just never know oh oh
Stars move shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire magic shakin' all the earth when a woman cries
Oh oh stars move thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky when a woman cries
When a woman cries aah when a woman cries yeah yeah 
When a woman cries when a woman cries oh

Silence - we hunt for the queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between
Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play hey-hey
Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Silence - we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold
Oh to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more
More's been empty for years
Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you
Small gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon

Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do
The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spider
Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes
Now I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Don't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wild
Why do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hear
Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
A spider
Inside her

You've made it through another day
Driving past the backroads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you
Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun
We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in
Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
No pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel
Some friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my way
Scream at the crazy ones
Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you
Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again
Again, again, again...

I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night - black as heaven
So no-one saw the gun
Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back around
Clutching to monsters in shadows
I can disappear - gone
Better in the dark

If they take away your song
You can finally hear the voices
Of the ones that don't belong
In the face of the rising wind
We all sing Gloria
Is there flame without fire
Most unlikely
If you're there when the walls come down
We all sing - warrior
Is there sight without sound
But we got rock and roll
Rock and roll
Take me anywhere
Is there someone there
On the edge of the last goodbye
Ah the brave never die
Hey, send your heroes of to war
But whisper in their ear
Never cross the song police
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again
For the sake of the left behind
Soon forgotten by time
So unlikely
Cause we got rock and roll
Take you anywhere
Someone's always there
Bring me anywhere
Rock and roll me, ah

You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push
You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
Go on and push

He'd never tell her lies
And she believed in magic
But when the magic died
She could see that all along he's just been
Guilty - a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty - burn in fire
It's time to say goodbye
Don't tell another story
Another alibi
Now you see that all along he's just been
Guilty - you burn in fire
Guilty - the great pretender
You're guilty - just surrender cause you're guilty
Broken promise
But please forgive again
One more time for me
It's the very last time - you'll see
Guilty - liar, liar
You'll burn in fire
Guilty - just surrender, you're guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty
A liar, liar
Guilty - you'll burn in fire
Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire
Surrender - guilty
So guilty

Oh-oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness
Wakes the dead
Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder
And she's afraid
Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
I'll make you safe and warm
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is no more little girl
Don't see her anymore
They disappear
Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today I heard that she was dead
You can hear them only if you try
Goodbye

Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousine
Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio
But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall
Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no
Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall
Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine
And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah

Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the show
The same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son
I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old time
There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Will you need more?
Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh
Where would you be without music
You wouldn't be nowhere it all
You wouldn't be here to invest,oh
If you weren't in heaven no more
One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Well,thank fully we've got the boys
The melody lies fascinated
The rhythm is something divine
Send out a trend of impatience
To see you all movin' so fine
Got to find it soon

Man eatin' momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys
She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
You can take her if you want her you can
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline

Got no silver for my pocket
got no pillow for my head
and the winter it gets stronger
got to ease my aching head
In the morning when I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'm dying
Or I'll got out of my mind
I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my sense reeling
Knowing winter's come to town

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep
She was a cheater
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you
You are a cheater
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go...
This could be or last show
Changing dreams changing schemes... NEVER
We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should I give sorrow, or turn 'round and sneer
I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride
Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall
I can't go on
I, I, I, I...

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open minded,but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said i was there
Lead to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led
Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day,
Is this the way that you get your fun slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun,
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob.
You make me sick getting paid for murder,
But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her.
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds 'cause you won't go to hell.
Take your medal, wear it now with pride.
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside.

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Second to none

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight
Capped everywhere
I've held my licence
It came with birth,
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions
To the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Look around
They're moving in
Hold your ground
When they begin
We can do it
We can do it and if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United we stand one and all
So keep it up
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
[fade]

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
[repeat and fade]

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight
I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance
I'm gonna take
Gonna get out trouble and strife
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise
No I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties
No compromise
Wanna taste what it's like to be free
I'm gonna gather my things
Go through the door
Every night I'll live on my own
I'd like to be there
And I'm gonna be there
I got a will of my own
I go as I please
Fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When I need it
Then I'll ask for advice
[fade]

From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
At every wind what a stake we're in
Is pain better than the grave
When we talk without amend
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike
Kiss of Judas, spider like
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
But you don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm elected protective, detective, Electric Eye!

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light.
Glowin' god of Mars
Body burning bright.
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind.
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power.
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud.
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds.

I've been trying
There's no denying.
It's sending me
Out of my mind.
I've seen reason
Change to treason.
It's losing its sense
Of all kind.
How much longer will it take
For the world to see.
We should learn to live
And simply let it be.
Bloodstone, bloodstone.
In the night time
Wake in fright.
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played.
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made
Bloodstone.
I can't take it.
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that bloodstone.

I move away it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like I thought it would.
Help me, I'm beggin' you please.
You've got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life.
Leave me be.
Take these chains off
Take 'em off of my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave
I tried to run but I'm tied to you like a slave.
It's my fault for loving you so
You were so precious, how could I know.
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me.
I don't owe you anything
Why don't you get out of my life.
Through it all the memories cling
And I can't sleep at night.

I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go.
I've heard the rumours and it seems they're comin' true
do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new.
Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through.
How I suffer for your love.
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried.
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life.
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
You don't know what I like.
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messin' 'round, practice what you preach.
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive

Hey listen don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right.
They're playing at a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear.
Always takin' baby out that's o.k.
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me.
Told you one you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face.
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place.
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace.
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you 'round in the torture before the dread.
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter.
As the sweat is runnin' down your neck
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up.
Oh your heart is pumpin' gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load.
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line.
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake.
I don't talk about it but that's alright
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight.
If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate.

One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud.
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'.
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best.
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.

I'd spend my days alone
I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there.
Like I was in a cell
A captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair.
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control.
Down on the streets below
Bright city lights would glow.
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze
Still counting empty days.
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break the spell.
Fever.  You set my soul on fire.
Fever.  You fill me with desire.
Fever.  You always get it right.
Fever.  All day and all night.
Then one night as I walked
I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar.
Oh how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this.
So destiny has brought us
Oh so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream
At last I'll be with you forever.
And all at once it feels so right.

Hypnotize me
Mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip.
Light my fire
With cold desire
Losing all my grip.
Eat my diamonds
Drinkin' all my gin
Feast your eyes on
A whole lotta sin.
On no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no got your claws stuck in my
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child.
Took my dreams
And now it seems you're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre.
Stop pretendin'
Got me growin' old
Your tormentin's
Fit to snap my soul.
You took my heart
And left it blown to smithereens.
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh
And drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed.
Goin' under
Hear the thunder
Death defying grace.
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face.
Vivious talkin'
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised, so abused
I'm a human sacrifice.

When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you.
You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You Pulled me back to earth
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future
Will you ever set me free
Take me into your arms again
In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain.

Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in
Never stops the Way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
You'll find there's life with victory
With victory on high
Freewheel burning [x8]

Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode - Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down
Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
All your life
Tough as steel
Stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
All your life...

Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figure's primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemned to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives
Now facing one another
The stand-off eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown

When you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise
That's when I crawl
Gliding on mist
Hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss
Evils abound
In the dead of night
Love bites
Into your room
Where in deep sleep
There you lie still
To you I creep
Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend
You smile as I sip
Now you are mine
In my control
One taste of your life
And I own your soul
Softly you stir
Gently you moan
Lust's in the air
Wake as I groan
Love bites you
Invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you
Delights you
It drains you to white
You knew at first sight
You'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite
There'd be no turning back
So come in my arms
I strike any hour
I will return
To trap and devour
Love bites...

Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
And eat me alive
Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver as
You give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as
The rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive

You can look to the left and look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights-flashing colors
Sleepless nights...
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks who are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
And slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day burning hell fire
You're blown away...
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
And the man with the power
No! No! ...

In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days (yeah)
That's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
And there's nowhere to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Then I will wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
And there's no place to go
Oh no!
You won't be there tomorrow
Say it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
And there's no place to go...

I know you like it hot
Love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside ya till the power splits your head
We're gonna rock ya till your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with an iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
So come on let's tell the world

Why do I have to wait so long
Before you come into my life again
Seems as though forever until
I can be here by your side till then
I think you feel the same way too
You know you make my dreams come true
If you'll just turn on your light
Let me see it shining through the night
When I'm far away from here
I'll hold all the memories so clear
If I only have the choice
I would stay so let me hear your voice

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one

When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimensions
It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling
Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings
Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision
An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
Your gonna get richer, I gotta get wild
Any time you want to
Any way you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Live that fantasy
I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane late at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light
You know where we're going
I know where we are
Set the rear view mirror for the backseat of the car
In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you
When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotised
Never seen nothin' like it no,
You won't believe your eyes
Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean
Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling to the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar
Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound
Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night
Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on
Do you love it loud

Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more the pain you'll feel
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice
Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
so expect the worst
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry, is victory, is victory

As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting
Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice
Not begging you
I'm telling you
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night
They're closing in
They'll never win
You won't make me,
As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down
just I'll face you under
Hands of justice
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear

The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me
And carved out of stone
I've broken hearts
Made people sing
I've drove a million miles
I've done everything
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
And no one can take that away
Bring on the night
That's when I live
I come alive inside
Give all I can give
I live each day
Like it's my last
I live for rock and roll
I never look back
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

The greatest times, I've ever known

And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

You get me up, then we both get down
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds
I'm all tied up on your bed
I'd rather be inside your head
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back
Then you ease off with your attack
You're the best I've had if you please
You never stop, you great big tease
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show

It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all
corners of the land
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of
hand
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Impossible to stop
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in
awe
At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for
And millions roared, and millions cheered
This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore en-captured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Pain! Pain!
Killer! Killer!
Can't stop the Painkiller!
Pain!

Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road
Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol
Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground
Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you
Crome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All Guns, All Guns Blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
With a burning heart
Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
No-one survives
Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground
High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing lazer
Burning glaze
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud
It's comin' - Meltdown
Start runnin' - Countdown

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Force rises
False rituals
Baptises
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
The burning sermons consecrate their sin

You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
You're possessing me
In the night please set me free
I can't resist your Touch of Evil
A Touch of Evil
Touch

Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins
Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see
This day will last forever
Deep in the hearts of men
Courage and victory
Remember, remember
One Shot At Glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire
Fighting on with dignity
In life and death we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel
I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
Fight fight fight
Fighting the world every single day
Fighting the world for the right to play
Heavy Metal in my brain
I'm fighting for Metal 'cause it's here to stay
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting the World
I been fighting
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight
Now people keep asking if we're going to change
I look'em in the eye
Tell'em no way
Stripes on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel not clay
See my brother standing by my side
Only got one thing on ever mind
Radio's playing this nation wide
Turn it up louder till we all get fright
Fight - Fighting the World

Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.
What's goin' on now
Don't ya care about me?
Send the same letter to the radio, Ha!
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head
We all like it - Rock And Roll
We all want it - on your show
Play it loud  don't play it low
Blow Your Speakers with Rock And Roll
We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'
People want music to get'em movin'
We don't want labels
We want music on the cable
We want it
We got lotsa stations

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Always Carry On

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me
Are you ready?
Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man
Violence and Bloodshed
Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me
My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end
Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent
Father, father, father
I look up to you and heed thy call
This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be

Damnation, Religion
Salvation, Fire and Steel

I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere
Holy, Holy War
Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Baptized in Fire and Steel
For the end we bring is soon
Now face the storm
A Holy War
Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Black Dogs howl in the night
The Lion is dead!
A Solitary Messenger
The Master of Revenge

Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.
I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Wheels of fire ride

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes
We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down
other bands play Manowar kill

Built a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind, born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise
With fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

Brothers the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the Battle Hymns
Into Glory Ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're Fighting the World
Side by side
On a crusade
The world we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king
Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France
Will not fail
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy
Switzerland, Austria
Back to the Glory of Germany
Sound the Death Tone
On our March for Revenge
Spill the Blood of my Enemies
The Oath of a Friend
Fight the Holy War for The Crown and the Ring
Six magic circles made by the Blood of the Kings
Wherever we ride it's metal we bring
Blood of a king.

[PRELUDE]
[I HECTOR STORMS THE WALL]
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
[II THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS]
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
[III FUNERAL MARCH]
[IV ARMOR OF THE GODS]
[V HECTOR'S FINAL HOUR]
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
[VI DEATH HECTOR'S REWARD]
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Die, die, die...
[VII THE DESECRATION OF HECTOR'S BODY]
[PART 1]
[PART 2]
[VIII THE GLORY OF ACHILLES]
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers go on get out
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers I said
There's metal in the air tonight, can you hear it call
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky

The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.
Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me
When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die
Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave
There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind

In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring

Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die
Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine
We are the undefeated we're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel
Livin hard and ridin fast
No one controls our goddam lifes

Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son

In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky
From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion it's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight
We believe in the power and the might
We're here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

Some want to think hope is lost see me stand alone
I can't do what others may want then I'll have no home
So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage ride into the night
Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul will point the way to victory
If there's a fight then I'll be there, I'll be there
So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Lift your wings up high my friend fearless to the end

We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king
All of the dreams held deep inside have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king

I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell

When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
[Repeat 3, 4, 5, chorus to fade]

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
[Repeat chorus]
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song
[Repeat chorus to fade]

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
[Bridge:]
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
[Chorus:]
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
[Repeat bridge, chorus]
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
[Chorus:]
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
[Repeat chorus]
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived
[Repeat chorus, 2nd verse, chorus]

Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
[Repeat chorus]
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
[Repeat all]

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
We know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land

We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

We are trying to get the message to you

Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Now your ships are burned
And the evil has returned
It will creep upon you
There's nothing to do
It will rip up your mind
And death you will find
Life is just a game
And death is just the same
Within the blood stained walls
In the center of your brain
Demons without mercy
Driving you insane
When the Orders are obeyed
And you have been slayed
You're lying on the ground
Without making a sound
As your soul fades away
You can hear someone say:
Ring the dooms day bell,
Turn the world into hell!

There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Because I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me
I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side
I'm trying to fight
For what is right
But evil spirits pass me by
They do what they want
They just don't care
What you feel or what you say
Where the road is leading us

No... No!
I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars
Who's to run and who's to fight?
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die
Who's to lose and who's to win?
I'll see the light tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life tonight!
Now the chaos has begun, people crying out
You're all alone, you gotta run!
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide
No we never had a chance!
No... Oh Oh Oh Oh!
Take my life tonight

You say the end of time is coming far too near
My love for life is torn in vain through all the years
What's the answer to the question
that we have been searching for
Can you tell?
Don't wanna fall apart before we have a chance
to try again
Don't let it end...
I tried so hard to make it right for you and I
Your sacred promises have all become a lie
Is this your idea of destiny?
'Cause if it is, just set me free
You can not fool me with your stories being told
My God it brings me down, I feel I'm growing old
No, please don't end it now, there is so much more
We can do, you know...don't let it end...
Let's gather what we had and build it up, again
It used to be so good, oh, please don't let it end

In the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall openIn the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall open

Oh Yeah!
I am a Viking I’m going out to war
I've got death upon my mind
As I was leavin' oh yesterday
I've got no fear in my heart
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through the waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah!
I am a warrior my mind is set to kill
Life or death is on the line
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel
I've got your life right in my hand
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah yeah! yeah!
You are a loser and it's such a shame
That you're a fool and you don't know
That I’m a Viking I'll walk all over you
And by my sword you will die
Dragon ships are charging through those waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah…yeah!
No No No… No!

No more will I do all the things that I've done
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find
His soul had wandered through years of despair
Eyes without expression told to beware
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high
To find they're forgotten to rest and to die

Outcast, not knowing right from wrong
Surrounded by women, wine, and song
Never still always on the run
Prince of the night, killing with a gun
Now, he's taken a life away
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay
Renegade, he fled from town to town
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down
For his head, lies a might price
He's a wanted man, dead or alive
Where will he go from here
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...
He's got mixed emotions running through his head
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead
He's on the run, again
Tell me when will it end

Now the battle is over, the clouds're hanging low
Dead bodies lie on the ground
Marched into slaughter, lost souls fought in vain
No glory or pride to be found
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around
Trying to find my way home
Fighting for honour and medals of gold
But, they were to kill or be killed
Slaying the enemy, not knowing why
Keep low and fire at will
Lost out in action, long gone forever
Just a boy that died in vain
His mother is crying, his father not proud
Twisted gray faces in the rain
Trying to find my way home...

Just an ordinary day, all around it seems O.K.
With a normal view
Then you open up your eyes, suddenly you realize
Everyone's confused
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be
Everyone around is sad, but, they analyze you mad
Sayin' you've lost your mind
Seems their lives have been abused
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find
Seems the whole society in the world's insanity

It was you, it was me,
And we would last forever.
Any fool could see, that we were 
Meant to be
Without you, there is no meaning to
My life.
You're gone and it cuts me like
A knife.
How could you leave me?
You don't remember, I'll never forget
You just don't remember, I'll never forget.
Why did you turn away,
Let your love fade away and die.
You became so cold, you made me feel
So old.
When you left, you broke my heart
And just to see.
How many pieces there would be,
After you leave me.
You just don't remember, I'll never forget

You came to me
You said you were my friend
I shared my art and my mind.
You found it easier
To steal than create.
Then call it your's, though it's mine
You can't fight, what is right
Face the truth, liar
You can't feel, you just steal
You smile in my face,
When I turn around,
You stick a knife in my back.
You think you're clever,
You know you're insane,
You're lies are not white they are black.

They all were there, the court was full
The king beside his queen
His love was cold, the fool will dance
for her 'till end of time,
The queen is in love,
The queen is in love.
She couldn't help her burning heart,
And now he's burning too.
Their love was blind,
They will dance until the end of time.
Queen is in love
The furious king now has learned
He sentenced them to burn.
Forever one,
They are joined in death eternally

I now will tell you all a story,
That no one ever heard before.
It is the tale about the fury,
Remember wisdom is your strength.
It said you're such a fool
Just let my evil rule
No, it's burning like a flame,
Now nothing seems the same.
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
It's wish is my command.
Enslaved forever by the fury,
By the fury, no!
At first it came to me in visions,
And that was filling me with pain
And when my fear became desire,
To let the demon burn my soul.
It said "Don't fight in vain,"
"I'll make you love the pain."
I now have told you all my story
And still for you its not too late.
Don't draw your sword
Just use your wisdom
And never let this be your fate.
Oh, no it's here again,
This demon loves the pain.

Born with the fire in my blood,
Can't live without it.
Something that gold can never buy.
It doesn't matter who you are,
Or what your thinking,
If you believe in what you try.
Feel the fire,
Your burning desire.
Fire, I'm burning up with fire
Fire, feel it burning higher
If you are rich, or if you are poor,
There is no difference,
It's still in what you're fighting for.
If you are strong you will survive,
You'll feel the fire,
Burning on forever more.
Feel the fire
Your burning desire
Fire, I'm burning up with desire
You never play with fire.

Everyone is searching for the
Meaning of our life.
Reading 'bout the hell and heaven
Believing all those lies.
Look upon yourself
Imagine you are two
Power lies within this is true.
Can't you see its clear like a mirror
It's all within what you're searching for
Magic mirror, magic mirror
Now your eyes are open,
and you know you were a fool.
You always had the power,
But you never broke the rules.
Power lies within this is true
Magic mirror, Magic mirror
Once again I say,
The strength that we are all searching for,
High and low we all looked in vain
Can't you see, it's clear like a mirror.
It's all within what you're searching for.

In the time, when darkness ruled
No one saw the light
In the cold black emptiness
Victims of the night
You can't fight what you can't see
To be or not to be
In the dark ages
Those evil days will still remain,
Till someone breaks the chains.
Just the strong survive,
You have to try, or you will die.
In the Dark ages

Out of the darkness, the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong
The lightning, strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I hear a rising force
Searching my soul, now I find something else
I take my life in my hands
Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The power is at my command
The lightning strikes, cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
I feel a rising force
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
The rising force starts to shine
A burning inferno, it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind

Look at me, see the love that you're missing
Can't you see that I'll always be there
You can't run you can't hide from the feeling tonight
Damage done. I guess love isn't fair.
Sometimes I wonder who you are
So close, but we've gone too far.
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl.
Lonely days, fill my nights with such sorrow
Shades of grey, turn into blue tomorrows.
Sometimes I wonder where you are
So close, but your eyes are so far.
You're gone and I can't go on and now my heart cries for you girl.

Lost in a dream in the arms of the night
Two lonely prisoners of our own device
Don't let me go. Hold on together
You wanna know if love can be real
I wanna take everything I can steal
Love on the line, it's now or never.
Why can't the night last forever.
This could be Paradise
Holding you here by my side
If we just close our eyes
We'll be in Heaven tonight.
Run through the night down streets of desire
Burning my soul, my heart's on fire
Give up the fight, it's sweet surrender
With trembling hands we reach for it all
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall
I need you now, now more than ever.
This feels like Paradise
I see the world in our eyes
If we just hold on tight

Shades of night, fall upon my eyes
Lonely world fades away
Misty light, shadows start to rise
Lonely world fades away.
In my dreams your face is all I see
Through the night you share your love with me.
Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.
Here we are on the crossroads of forever
Shining star lights the way.
Walk with me on the winds of time
Love's mystery is for us to find.
Until that day, until the day I find you
I won't rest, I won't let go
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you
To warm my heart and fill my soul.

Locked up in chains, backs to the wall
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call
Pushed from outside, thrown underground
Frozen in time we wait for the sound.
Oh, I feel something coming
Looks like a riot in the dungeon.
Trapped behind bars, prisoners of death
All hope is ours, we can't give up yet
Ready to fight to get what we need
Die on your feet or live on your knees.
Looks like a riot in the dungeon
You stand and die or start your running
'Cause there's a riot in the dungeon.
It's got to give, it's gonna break
Dying to live, our freedom's at stake
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood
We won't give in till they've had enough.

I always knew, somewhere in time
We'd meet again, we'd cross that line
Don't need to question, no reason why
The answer lies before your eyes.
Do you know who I am
Do you understand?
Deja vu, dreams come true
I see my soul inside of you
Deja vu, so many lives
Familiar spirits behind your eyes.
We cross between worlds through windows of light
With open arms we hold back the night
The crystal of power we hold in our hands
We go on forever and love is the plan.

We hold the secret to a dream
We keep it wrapped in chains
Locked inside a mystery.
We climb a stairway to the stars
Through doorways of the heart
Step inside, the magic starts.
Gaze into my crystal ball,
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.
You veil your eyes in fantasy
Time to pull the curtain back
Distant worlds, so much to see.
I wanna know you, come on let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you, reach out to these hands of fate
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

Hold on tight in the heat of the night
Baby there can be no escape
Feelings right, getting hard to fight
Baby how much more can I take.
Tell me that it's real, everything you feel
What am I supposed to do
Look into my eyes, touch me deep inside
Let me feel your love cut through.
Oh, now is the time
Feeling your heart so close to mine
Oh, I want your touch, need you so much
Now is the time for our love.
Drowning in the flames, in the sea of desire
Angel with the devil's eyes
Turn up the heat and we fall in the fire
Can't you feel the temperature rise.
Tell me that it's true, you can feel it too
Let me be your fantasy
Baby hold me tight, say that it's alright
You know you can count on me.
When the fire starts I can feel you burning tonight
With an open heart baby won't you let me inside,
Let me inside girl.

Step inside the dream machine
You're on a power drive
Feel the passion of the beast
Watch her come alive.
Oh, you're almost there, ride on silver air
You better hold on tight, she's fire in the night.
Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.
Got your hands upon the wheel
The pedal to the floor
Now it's time for nerves of steel
Hear the engine roar.
Oh, you shoot the thrill, heading for the kill
No control tonight, she's liquid dynamite.
Rev it to the Red line
You're tearing up the street
12 cylinders and she's all mine
She's too tough to beat
Oh, you shoot to thrill 
Heading for the kill
No control tonight
she's liquid dynamite

To be lonely is my only trust
In my silent movies 
I can expose my lust
Taking snapshots in the light
That I do recall when I retire
Playing with my fantasies I let the curtain fall
In my desire
Still I need that touch for real
To discover and to feel
You're the one that breaks my heart
And it's tearing me apart
Making love to you baby
Making love it's all I want
Making love
Every subway-every crowded street
Feeding my emotions
We pass but never meet
My touch is two dimensional
I slowly close my eyes and think of you
More or less invisible
Still you're my point of view
I can't get to you

Come on baby, what's on your mind
You're stumbling in the darkness
Like you're running blind
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
This same old graveyard
on the same playground
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round

Once we were one 
Now we're worlds apart
Deep inside you know you are my other heart
My memories seem like yesterday
Can't believe it's all so far away
All these years
All our tears
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
You said to me
That we hold the key
Eternal love we give and take
It was meant to be
My love for you
Was always true

With your love you gave me life
Not knowing right from wrong
You always know that I'll be strong
You set me free and you paid the price
You inspired me in my art
With the rebel in your heart
You gave nothing for nothing
But the spirit of you word happiness could bring
I learned to always do the best I can
You taught me to be true and I never ran
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Left all alone in the cold
Nowhere to go so I run like the wild
Stumbling, falling
Crying calling you...
As they gave nothing in return
You became their slave although you were brave
You still teach me what is left to learn
Though they brought you to the grave
You will remain to ease my pain

Don't ever try to fool me
Cause I can see right through you
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
Hold me, feel me
Wound and heal me
Mend this broken heart
Though you're near me
You can't hear me
But you tear my soul apart
I can't beat you
Can't defeat you
You just make me cry inside
Don't even try to fool me
My rage is growing stronger
And I can't wait no longer
Never learning
Vengeance is burning
Deep inside your mind
Time will come to
When I'll make you
Stumbling like blind leading the blind

I cast my pearls before the swine
Sealed and delivered
Then I drink your toast of wine
Though it's bitter sweet
I'm eating from you hand so neat
Pennies from heaven
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live 
Judas...Judas
Sightseeing through the lights
and shades of you mighty colonnades
No I got the picture
of the beauty and the beast
I am the lamb...you are the priest
To crucify me
To make a living...Makes no difference
Friends, you are what you do
Some are false and some are true
You haven't got a clue
I'd rather reign in hell some said
Than serve in heaven

I was carried to you
By the hands of my fate
Thought it was too late
I wasn't the type that believed in true love
At first sight
you changed it to the right
I know what I feel
This is real
I give you my body and soul
Let your resistance drop
Don't have to stop
By the siren's call
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I'm not the type to believe
in a second chance
Or in sweet romance
I'm no beginner been fooling around before
Still coming back for more
Today is different
It was meant
I've found a reason
There's more than one season
Time to think it over

My one way ride in dead end street
Leading to victory and glory
You seek I hide you'll find defeat
My future's in the hands of fury
You try - but never win
Can't you see I am the demon driver
Don't lie it is a sin
Cuz you know I am the demon driver
I live to drive and never wait
For guardian angels riding by me
To speed or die I'm never late
Wherever you are there will be

Something deep inside, far from reality
We pretend it never crossed our mind
we feel but never sense
Building up a strong defense
Some say it's our destiny, Lord...
We're living on the faultline
Get out of here
Cry the prophets of our time
Fear the signs
Save those you love and all your children
You life depends on castles in the sand
Don't look back there is no promised land
We don't want to hear that this could be the day
So much for science fiction
as you always say
But soon the day will come
It's only just begun
For the people on the faultline
it's no use to pray
Why living in danger
Why living in danger, danger

Can't bow for a rule
Cause I'm nobody's fool
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win
Sometimes I might be rude
Acting in my mood
I'm trying to be straight
Cause I don't want to be late
There's nothing you can say to make
me feel worse than I do (how are you)
You can't buy my freedom
Keep me locked in your cell
Sad how we waste our energy
When all our days are few (makes me blue)
We're two of a kind me and you
I guess that I'll see you in hell
Who is my friend
Who will remain
Seems like I always stand alone in the end
Nobody lasts until the end
You can't buy my life and freedom
It's more than just buy and sell
You can't keep me locked in your cell
See you in hellNow the time has come for me to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help
With swords in the night
Oh the last part of the game
Decision of death and life
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight
The final battle cry
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying for all
Children of death
I have a dream the things you've to hide for
Deliver our kingdom and our Reich
Don't fall in panic just give me the thing
That I need or I kill
Don't run away for what have I done
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And you'll leave us behind
And ruins remind of your time
Now come back
Run, run, run
Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Creature is following no place to escape
My last steps will find the right way
Where's the future the call of the blind
Cause there is none to find
Watch the sky you see no light
My weapons burst with fear
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die
For all Children of death
Run Run for the whole world
It's time you cannot wait
Lost Lost in a dark world
You feel the strange but cannot see
Too many battles we carry along from the war
And too many frightens we feel from his law
For so many victories we're praising so strong
For so many blood we've lost
Run, run

Extermination thunder the strange one is back again
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us out forever
Fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die
I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
I find taste on lampskin everything's allright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Now it feel the curse of the child
Dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it again
Fear our returning visions to madness we'll fall
if we can't kill the beast forever we must die now
One has blown his life away
Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die
By a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
little Billy you must find your way
Believe in you we ask for but where
we can never find
there must be a sign for the
Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse
Come to it's world following the sign
Give us the help we're waiting for your sign

Years ago I came back
this has been my hardest attack
A burning fire's in my brain
I could feel the deadly flame
Tales of the magic in my head
to a dark dream I fall in my mind
I hold the key of fortune
To feel the strange thing's in my mind
the stone of Ambar I must find
I'll take the chance that day
Halloween - The wizards crown I'll take on
Halloween
Halloween - But there is no return on Halloween
I'm the servant of the Blind to cross the
realms of death
the gate is open wide you cannot close
His dungeons deep no place to hide
The times have changed he has to fight
In magic spell I fall
Illusions falling in my mind
But where's the key I cannot find
the ritual has begun
The battle has begun
the warlocks time has come
I pay the price I've to pay
Why haven't see the signs
I'm loosing now my life
but cannot die forever life

There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creature will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
Run for the Night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and blooddlust their weapons and madness
you see their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
who the mightiest of all will now
You see them running in the shadows of the night
It is not what it used to be
they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you them running with the wind they
run for the night [3x]

He was born in the past time
To take all our pain
The kingdom of heaven's near
The children of this time
Must die for his arrive
To let all the legends be true
The prophecy said they'll call king of the Jews
He is born now to take all our sins
Three kings were searching for this holy child
The journey begins, he has to die
Healing the cripples and taking our pain
He came for the sinner
But what we've said
Disciples are following
They are calling his words
Salt of the earth and light of the world
Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
Messiah - we are torturing you
When you lose the power of your words
Jump from the temple and angle will save
Show me that you are the son of our God
Now take my land with my power you get
Rulin' the world of tomorrow
Messiah liar our burning desire
He is the king without a crown
We'll set him to his throne
Give me 30 p of silver and I'll be your man
Higher liar the fallen Messiah
Let us see his agony
The things he done are blasphemy
Mob has lost their joy on toy
So let us kill him fast
Now drink my blood for the new testament
This is my body you eat
One of you twelve is the one who betrays
Better that he's never born
Judas you're the chosen one
The world has damned your name
Begin with a kiss
At a cross it will end
The kingdom of heaven we've passed
The sky will turn black and the curtain will fall
The father's crying for his son
The tortured Messiah is finding his way
The journey has come to the end
The twelve ones are preaching the words he'd left
They're changing the way of the world but die for
No

Can't believe the things I see
That happens in the state
By a mortal distance that I can't believe
Self destructive infernal
To save us from the breed
But I know that it is all a lie
Star wars begin now
His bombs come exploding
To bring back the death of the night
No mercy he's knowing
How strong he must show us
For the last film you all get a part
Be by my side
Or you've to die
Believe what I do is the right
Soon Armageddon
Last hours are running now
The final solution begins
The words of a madman
No children to tell them
For what they'll not see in the light
Choose by your voice
He kills and destroys
At the end you must die for the night
In earlier chess games
We're playing the part of a soldier
But now we are not qualified
To save our own life
The traps are all placed by command
They are ready to strike
We live and we'll die
By the lies to believe
Try to escape from this suicide dreams
Or past time will come back again
Hiroshima is a joke to that what will come
At the end of the game we all die
Die now
Battalions of fear
They search and they scream
For the American dreams
The way of R.R.
To show he is the star
Battalions
Star wars
With hands full of blood
He talks about peace
With snake poisoning tongue
He's praying
El Salvador and Vietnam
You soon fast forget
But you satisfy on Afghanistan
You've been the master
You kill with a laughter
Your screams of peace are wrong and loud
Cause so we are and here we are
We scream and shout!
Your laughing about all the fools
Scream and shout!
With power of evil they stand

No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
"All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone"
"Save me your speeches
I know (They blinded us all)
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore"
Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"(We're) lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone
Come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown"
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Immortal land lies down in agony
"How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be"
But even in silence I heard the words
"An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken"
Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
"I swear revenge"
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge
"Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But) freely you came and
You freely shall depart
(So) never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends"
"Oh I'm heir of the high lord!"
"You better don't trust him"
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said
Back to where it all began

Far, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain
It lies unknown
The land of mine
A hidden gate
To save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence
Words of wisdom
I've seen the end of all
Be aware the storm gets closer
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
That tomorrows bears insanity
Gone's the wisdom
Of a thousand years
A world in fire and chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far
Deep down it lies my secret vision
I better keep it safe
Shall I leave my friends alone
Hidden in my twilight hall
(I) know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames
Alone
How shall we leave the lost road
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Even though
The storm calmed down
The bitter end
Is just a matter of time
Shall we dare the dragon
Merciless he's poisoning our hearts
Our hearts

Light fails at dawn
The moon is gone
And deadly the night reigns
Deceit
Finally I've found myself
In these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?
Barren and lifeless the land lies
Lord of all Noldor
A star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord
The Fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
I stand alone
Noone's by my side
I'll dare you
Come out
You coward
Now it's me or you
He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries
Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned
The iron crowned
Is getting closer
Swings his hammer
Down on him
Like a thunderstorm
He's crushing
Down the Noldor's
Proudest king
Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain
The Elvenking's broken
He stumbles and falls
The most proud and most valiant
His spirit survives
Praise our king

I feel cold
Facing the darkness
The light's gone away
Deep in his castle he said
All land'll be mine
There's one thing for sure
The triumph of shadow is near
Deep in his castle they sang
We shall not rest
Until all will be thyne
All land is mine
You can be sure
Don't dare me
the mighty one screamed
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till I'm king
Valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
Rise of Fall
a dark tale ends
just wondering how
in the darkness
they found their way
to the right place
children of the sun
second kindred
we call their race
treat them kindly
born in the east
(are the) nightfearer
they moved westwards
towards the sunshine
(they are) morning breath like
short's their life
(like) dawn passes by
when the day comes
the field was lost
(and) hope had passed away
the sun went down
beyond the sea
dark was the hour
but day shall come again
Clean my wounds
wash away all fear
let courage be mine
noone hears me crying
no song no tale
which contains all the grief
(but)
renowned the deeds
and the victims of defeat
sit down on your chair
and look out for your kin
with my eyes you'll see
and with my ears you'll hear
you troubled my day
and you've questioned my strength
(but) don't mess
with the master of fate
I smashed down the light
and dared Valinor
revenge will be mine
Slowly marching on
still we're marching on

I've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom
I've tasted poison
When I drank the wine of fate
But the fear was in my heart
I realized too late
The house of spirits call
Song of the doom
High's the fee
Soon my spirit will return
Welcome dawn
Your light will take me home
I say farewell
To the Eldar

It cannot be seen but there's blood on the green
Only God knows I'm innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me like the Storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
They're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still instead
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son they're gone
The Sun shines bright and anger rises
Lorn and lonely torn apart
Don't you think it's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
Let's pray that heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror shall honour arise
So let's pray and blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me crying, crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name
That's what the minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord

Run
'Til you find the answer
Time out
For our poor Cassandra
She's fairly safe inside the fire
Inside the fire
Awakes desire
Cruelly admired
They'll torture her soul
And they'll torment her heart
But won't change her mind
Would you like to see me
How I'll cut off
Her head life's a game
A lesson to learn
Don't be shy just blame me
Well, there is no
Need to feel ashamed
Remember the oath
Wake up
It's time to cross the border
Is it true what they say
About the part you've played?
Enjoy your stay here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
Please understand
It's not in our hands
Barren the land
It's all dead and gone
And still the tyrant's face is red
So witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
It's the sweetest taste
King of terror just stop wining
Hold your breath it won't take long
Realize this is your judgement day
In between the killing carry on
There are no rules here
Try to understand
You're the artificial enemy
An illusion we all need
For our sake
We're not allowed to see beyond that's your skill
Will we ever learn the lesson "We can't fly with broken wings"
Break the chains
Time to change
I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part
It's been nice we now get to the climax
Your destination's unknown
Just get out of my way
Don't mind the blood here
(No more gods)

A wooden cup and a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free
It doesn't matter anymore that someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before the Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me, shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
"The king's in town
We need a crown"
I think we all know how it ends
"So we're not going take it longer"
So all I know is I don't care
Now we are aware
There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance I hear the voices say
"We get him home tonight and that's all you need to know"
I'm alone
So I can't stand it any longer
And don't want to see it all
Nazarene, your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you

The faithful crowd is gathered here
Soon they'll appear
The high and mighty show up the king
Is in doubts
"Apart from this beggar here
There's no one like you my dear
Tasting my lips
No one but you and him"
Round the fire everyone should sing
And praise the gracious queen
Round the fire everyone should dance
And we praise the handsome knight
Forever and ever we both will be one
The maiden, the fair and the young
Fell in love
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
There's a moment in life when all the years will pass by
And the eyes filled with tears we once shed
We recognize failures, the desperate cries
Of the ones who believed in our lies
Whenever I'll go you'll be with me
My first though and my last
Though we'll depart in bitterness
One day you'll understand
Carry on
Beloved maiden, mine
Or we have to pay the price
Yesterday's memories and melodies
Are gone with the wind, so sad
Snow-white her hands and golden her hair
But she's not the one
Out in the emptiness where everything's pale
There is no sign of you, I'm alone
How I wish you would be here, I'm alone
Telling me it's alright, come rest (your head)
Come rest your head
I'm alone and sadness reigns in my heart
As long as we live it won't go away
We are one but torn apart
Proudly it stands
Until the world's end
The victorious banner of love

I cannot say that I don't care cause I'm aware
Of everyone and everything they're everywhere
Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain, your brain
The cautious hare cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
(He constantly) knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on
Silent creature, filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease, a release
A vanished kingdom falls
It goes on, on and on and again
It goes on, round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head
Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
I will wait for an answer so far
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation, we're the chosen ones
We're the tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels
Well the time is right you shall be on my (side)
I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen
There is not the slightest doubt at all
Not at all
In lower airs we're ground down by their ignorance
Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer
Round and round it goes on and again oh
I can't get it out of my head
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no
The hopeful he sadly admits there's no hero
No place to hide there is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground
It's you who has said there's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within, it's in your mind

I'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful, cruel but wise beyond his age
My body fails
My soul will (rise)
The end of life's immortalized
Disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
(Beyond the door)
There's something more
It seems there's just one way
On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel
The icy claw in me
For a descent price I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty pawned for my desire
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
And through the hour glass
Everything's grey, everyone's pale
Nor colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold
Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive
Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night
From a distant time voices echo in the hall
"Come and join us, enter life and everything is gone now"
And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and
Its loss in the end
(Unlimited) power in my hands
("Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned")
The claw of the dragon ascends
Each step I take mMay it hurt may It ache
Leads me further away from the past
But as long as I breathe (and) each smile on my bleak face
I'm on my way to find back to the Peace of mind

Cut off the light, take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope is gone
What have I done?
Denied the father and the son
For a moment it seemed
There's space beyond the spheres
Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
(You've been sacrificed in fear)
Now there's one thing for sure
I'm not afraid anymore
Day after day we've been fixed in this bowl for so long
For ages we're captured in shells and crystallized walls
Predestined or punished? By Man or God?
I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
The age of false innocence
(Take it away from me)
(And) for a while astronomy has moved the Earth
And we've turned around the Sun
(Sanctum Officium)
Has made me believe
"We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it to hear you crying"
I've slaughtered truth and I've shattered my heart
Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel, so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree
(Take It away from me)
Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part so we bleed in the name of God
Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven there won't be release
(I cannot) I will not

It's warm and tender but very soon it will turn cold
Shadows stare down from the walls
Out of the mist it's coming closer now
It never rains -- it pours on me
So let the saints
Set up the courtyard, the unpleasant cage
The obvious point is I'm insane
Was I aware whom I has slain, I fear I was:
The faceless
The nameless
The bush set on fire
No one ever dared to speak
"Shame on me, I don't believe
The here and now Is all we're living for"
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Witness my last breath
I do not regret
A word I've said
The strong will survive
The weak must die
And out of the mist
It's coming closer now
Sinner and saints --
The grateful slaves
Nature's law instead of God in heaven
From far beyond
I can hear them sing
I hear angels sing
Songs of innocence
I hear the angel sing
Despite the facts are clear
It cannot be, what we can't see
I must admit, it sounds so sweet
Angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
Far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"
From far beyond I hear them sing
Well we all know there's no other side
It's good and evil
I know right between, there's no borderline
This is the punishment divine
Surrounded by night, I've been offered insight
There is none but the sin of pride
Am I wrong am I right? Am I losing my sight?
Abandoning the superior mind
(Right away)
Through the valleys grey
(I will be gone)
Through the shapeless land I walk alone
I'm left alone
Through the deepest void, a blackened paradise
I walk alone, I'm left alone

Turn your head and see the fields of flames
(Don't move along)
He carries along
(Cause things they will go wrong)
From a distant place
(The end is getting closer)
He's on his way
(Day by day)
He'll bring decay
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight
Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for the starlight we wait for the Moon
The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
we're getting nowhere
We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome
We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight
It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall
Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out
We don't regret it
So many men have failed but now he's (gone)
Go out and get it
The madman's head it shall be thine
That someone else dies hidden in (disguise)
Orion's hound shines bright
Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running, running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided
By the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach
Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra, you may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Find myself in darkest places
(Sister mine)
Find myself drifting away
(Death's a certain thing)
And the other world
The other world appears
Find myself she dies in vain
I cannot be freed, I'm falling down
As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you, my dear
And then there was silence
Just a voice from the other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade
Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of three you've chosen misery
Power and wisdom you deny
(Bad choice, bad choice)
War is the only answer when Love will conquer fear
So the judgement's been made
To the fairest the graceful says
Badly he fails
(Warning)
Fear the heat of passion, father king
(Don't let him in
Don't let her in)
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
(We can't get out
Once they are in)
She's like the sunrise
Outshines the Moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price
(In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat)
Jealousy
(I can clearly see the end now)
I can clearly see the end now
(The thread of life is spun)
The coin's been placed below my tongue
Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side so we can win
Be on out side
(Old moon's time) is soon to come
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man
Roar Roar Roar Roar
Troy (Troy Troy Troy)
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb
(Hallowed) Troy will fall round the walls
Faith is shattered, bodies fall
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out
I feel that something's (wrong)
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept out of sight
We live
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
(Roam in darkness)
(We will be lost if you truly believe)
Troy in darkness
(There's a cold emptiness in our hearts)
That they've gone away
(And) won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite the end is near
You better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The war it is over forevermore
No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied
Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die
(Will) my weary soul find release for a while
Holy light shines on
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
The crack of doom, Father
Your handsome son is heading home
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
(Out of mind)
(Can't get it)
(Still the wind blows, calm and silent)
(Carries news from a distant shore)
(Can't get it out of my head)
Sorrow and defeat

Stop be quite now
Out with the light and
Then up and down it goes
Fly
Out with the light
There at the door
The inspiration I've looked for
The spirit of the youth appears
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe
Make believe
But one day
It all will come to life
Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
Then away we'll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark
In the land of mine
The second one to right
And then straight on
Until morning light
No irritation
No, not the slightest doubt
We got once
Quick - we better hurry
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts
And imaginations
These things will lift you up
What is it like?
You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies
Or things to fear?
For fairies sake I'd say
You better come with me
So soon you'll see
Now up and down it goes
And round
Round and round and round
Praise
To my cleverness
They all follow me
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs
Fly in
Fly out
They'll leave it all behind
No one ever dares to speak...
Life is a map
And it is quite confusing
The lights are up
Now let the play begin
She flies, she flies
Into the light she flies
No words like "Just" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now, now, nowWorkin' this job ain't payin' the bills
Sick and tired rat race takin' my thrills
Kickin' down the road not a dime in my pocket
Nightime falls and I'm ready to rock it
I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day 'cause we're gonna scream
Night songs
Howl into the light singin'
Makes the day right
Raise your glass take a bite
Ridin' to the east and ridin' to the west
Sleepin' all day but never get a rest
Lookin' at the time stand still it ain't right
Livin' for the moment time to get it tight
Night songs [13x]

All right yea
I met this girl around quarter to ten
We made it once she said "make me again"
She wrapped her love around me all night long
In the mornin' we were still goin' strong 
Now let me tell ya it sure feels good
First time I saw that girl I knew it would
Now let me tell ya it sure felt right
No pullin' teeth she didn't want to fight she said 
Shake me
All night 
She said
Shake it don't break it baby
All night
All night long
All night long baby 
Screamed and scratched and rolled out of the bed
I never really got her out of my head
And now and then she makes those social calls
Gives me a squeeze gets me kickin' the walls 
Now let me tell ya it still feels tight
And we were shakin' after every bite
I feel her comin' in the middle of the night
screamin' higher 
ooo yea
All night, keep the fire burnin' cause we're doin' all right
All night, come on and shake it right 
ooo yea 

I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties
I call you on the phone
But never get a rise
So sit there all alone
It's time you realize
I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's foooool
I'm no fooool
Never again no no
You take your road I'll take mine,
The paths have both been beaten
Searchin' for a change of pace
Life needs to be sweetened
I scream my heart out just to make a dime
And with that dime I bought your love
But now I've changed my mind
I'm no fool
since we broke the ties

When you see your face in the mirror
Does it seem the end is gettin' nearer
All your life you spent as a wheeler
Now the hole you dug, it gettin' deeper
You're talkin' words
But they don't make the rhyme
You'll lose it all
Cause you can't draw the line
You got nothin'
Nothin' for nothin'
You're hurtin' overtime
And we don't need your kind
Pushin', shovin', got no time
When you see the day gettin' darker
You can run to yuor lies, run to your cover
When you feel the heat from a lover
You hit the highway lookin' for another
You made the grade
You left the hills behind
You take the the cake and eat it
You're so blind
Nothin' for nothin', hey
Hey

See me, feel me, come and touch me
The way I touch you
In the crossfire, live wire
Who said maybe
I said maybe won't do
The sands of time are slipping by
Dust to dust, no second try
You're only goin'
Once around the ride, yea
Once around the ride
Rock hard, got an ace card
I ain't crazy
Just got nothin' to do
Day breaks, I'll take
Can't wait forever
Cause my life will be through

We hang tough
When the chips are low
Can't buy enough
So we steal the show
We get so hot
We can't cool down
So the hell with that
We're rippin' through your town
We've had enough of the raw deals
Hit the road and tell ya how it feels
Like hell on wheels
We live fast
But we love it so
Can't see the past
But it's gone we know
We're burnin' through your town
Run like hell
Hell on wheels

When I was a young boy
they said you're only gettin' older
but how was I to know then
that they'd be cryin' on my shoulder
put your money in a big house
get yourself a pretty wife
She'll collect your life insurance
when she connects you with a knife
Somebody get the doctor,
I'm feelin' pretty poor,
somebody get the stretcher
before I hit the floor
Somebody save me
I lost my job, they kicked me out of my tree,
save me
Everybody's got opinions
but nobody's got the answers
and the shit you ate for breakfast
well it'll only give ya cancer
We're runnin' in a circle
runnin' to the mornin' light
and if ya ain't quite workable
It's been one hell of a night
I think I'm gonna crash
Never paid the bill
because I ain't got the cash
save me, look out
Save me
I'm goin' down for the last time, look out

I've been loved and I've been shoved
Beaten every step of the way
Lived by the glass
And got a little ass
Three or four times a day
Well, I've seen blood like Noah's flood
I think its gonna take us away
Tellin' you should listen real good
Hell's come back to stay
Well you can't take it with you
It's a one way ride
Baby's had enough of lookin'
In from the outside
Feelin' down low, time to let go
You're only as good as you please
Walk before you crawl, make the last call
You need it like a social disease

I'm gettin' hot
I've got to give a shot
She wants it all
And that's a lot
I'm gettin' ready
The love's lookin' steady
It's gettin' sticky
I thought she might miss me
She looked at me and said
I need a little
Push, push
Gonna give a little
If ya take a little
Then you'll get a little
She's lookin' fine
Flashin' like a neon sign
She thinks it's love
I said that comes with time
Come and give a little
Whoa, yea
Push on
Woo, push, push
Mmm, keep pushin' me
Ooo, yea, yea

I hit the road wide open at seventeen
Mama cried herself to sleep
Lost a dad I'd never seen
Took all my childhood friends
Guitar, and a dream
Some say I got it bad
I say I've got the cream
No, no, no
I roll into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black
Go, go, go
I hit the stage and you make me feel like I'm back
I'm back
Back home again
Back home
I worked from nine to five at twenty-two
Felt good to stay alive
Good times were far and few
Trustin' my hopes and dreams
With someone who said they knew
Just how to make ends meet
They haven't got a clue
I rolled into town and I'm spinnin' my wheels to black
Take me back

Sit there thinkin'
In your room
You feel the pressure
You're goin' crazy too
The walls around you
Closin' in
You need a change
Claustrophobic
Feelin' scared
You need somebody
But no one seems to care
A one way ticket
A change of pace
You've had enough
Can't take no more
Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains
Got this letter
Came today
From my baby
Who left me yesterday
Said she loves
She'll come back
She wants to try
I won't let her
She'll be upset
I know it's better
Than somethin' I'll regret
She's been dishonest
And insincere
I lost my mind
Twenty times a year
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains
Woke up today
I'm alone
I look around
But baby you were gone
But I don't mind
And I don't worry
I will survive
Now that you're gone
Don't need nobody
To hold or tie me down
I broke the chains
So let me be
I've gotta be free

I talk with you
I think of her
It always turns out the same
I changed my mind
Then I'm not sure
Love's got me shackled in chains
Win or lose
We've lit the fuse
I've lost control
Then you explore my soul
In the middle
Of love
Torn apart
Right from the start
Is it too late to be true?
Now things have changed
We're not the same
I lose control
I lose my mind as well
Everyday
Love's got me chained

Felony
In tight blue jeans
I did not know
She was so sweet
What ya did to me
The judge said sorry
First degree
You're here in my heart
Felony, felony, felony, yeah
Felony, felony, felony
Well I was shot down
By a heart so cruel
You were were laughin' yeah
You took me for a fool
I'm struck down
Left lyin' in the dirt
I never knew
How much love it hurts
Harvard paid
Detective man
I'm in his sights
I'm on the run
Those tight blue jeans
That drove me wild
She was just a child
Felony, yeah

You keep me waitin'
Why I don't know
Seems like forever
You know the show
I wanna see you
Don't want it to end
But when I'm callin'
You tell me again
I can't see you anymore
All my friends keep tellin' me, yeah
That I'm just a fool
But baby I can't help myself
I'm in love with you
Give me just one chance
And I'll make it right
Could be forever
Don't tell me tonight

Run out of breath
And I feel I'm moving too slow
Backwards and forwards
I don't know which way I should go
There's a solution
To make all your feelings alright
The music's here waiting
So come on and get it tonight
Live to rock
Rock to live
It's all you got when
You're down on the skids
One way or another
Survive until the end
Over and under
I'm feeling the thunder take hold
Feeling it flow through my veins
Rock will never get old
You're down on the skids, yeah
'til the end

It's late at night
I get that feeling running through my veins
You know it drives me insane
In the car, slam the door, turn the key and I'll be free
On that highway tonight
Highway bound
I'm so alive
I'm shifting into overdrive
Nightrider
Autobon
Route 61
I'll drive this road into the sun
My machine is tired and cool
I don't need to go to school
I'll put the hammer down and I'll leave this town
I'm racing time
The freeway just seess to unwind in front of me
And there's no return
My wheels of love
Fit me like a racing glove
Don't touch the brake
Don't cross the line
Don't make mistakes
'Cause you know that I'm
Here I come
The engine roars
I'm locked inside my doors
On a midnight run
But who knows when
Danger lies around the bend for me
With the morning sun
Pass her by
Faster than the speed of light
You better run
Look out now
'Cause here I come

Demon eyes
And the fate is coming down on you
Fire in her eyes
The love she gives she says is all for you
Come the night
You will pay the price
In the night
No one by your side
She will come to you
She take you down
Seven thunders
In her eyes
And no where you can hide
If you can
Won't stop to look at where she's been
All the same
She's telling lies if you believe its true
Comes the night
She'll take you down
She will come and take your life
She will seal your fate
She threw the dice
Seven Thunders
You pay the price
Now she took you in the night
She told you lies
The love she brings is not for you

Staying out all night dancing
You can't keep them at home, no
She'll tease and smile
She'll play for a while
She's got it under control, yeah
I hope it's me tonight
She's looking for
Oh, sweet young girls
I love them all
Young girls
Driving me crazy
The doctor says I must slow down
I gotta leave them alone, yeah
All I know if I'm gonna die
What way to go
You're driving me crazy
Beautiful ladies
I want them all
I love them all, yeah
I want them all, yeah
Those beautiful ladies
Oh yeah
How old you anyway?

Well I've been trying this for so very long
To make you understand
If you'll fight for what you need
Don't come crawling over to me
I'm not the kind of person who quits
Even when the chips are down
You gotta fight for what you want
Don't give up
Stick to your guns
Gotta believe in what you do
A hard time you've been having
Don't feel bad if you're on your own
If you fight for what you want
Things ain't gonna turn out so bad
You gotta stick to your guns
Well, I'll tell you
I gotta tell you
You got to stick to your
You got to stick to your guns

This town I'm in can't take no more
Decadence is silly
You were my woman
Why'd you have to be so hard and cold
Paris is burning
Want to see it from afar
Want to get to where you are
My life's in ruin
The girl I love
She's far away
The distant fire
Brings memories of the love
That I once knew
Where are you now
Been looking all around
And I can't stay
Help me now
I can't stay
Much more before I fade away
Get back where you are
I can't believe
You'd throw it all away
You know you played me for a fool
I'm leavin' now
This time you know
That I'll be gone for good, yeah
Paris is burning, Paris
Paris [Fade Out]

Desperate living- driving me mad
Writings on the wall
Crushed all our hopes and the dreams we once had
Just to watch them fall
Tearing it up in the daytime
Burning it down at night
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail
Last generation- reckless and free
Up against the odds
Thoughts of revenge are going trough me
Fate lies in the cards
Desperate living- trying to see
Breaking all the rules
Only the strongs are gonna be free
From a world of fools

I should've known better
Should've seen right through
Over and over falling in love with you
Wanting you for myself- my first mistake
Finding out the hard way
Was all that I could take
You were just using someone
And I was the one
She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
You're a devil in disguise
Don't wanna hear no lies- no apologies
Imagination gets the best of me
I'm looking everywhere- still I see your face
I'll never forget you- you put me in my place
I've been hypnotized
Now that is over and I've seen right through
Not looking back again I'll start anew
Was making love to you such a wasted time
Maybe I love you, still, I'll get you off my mind
I was taken by surprise

Every night is the same old thing
Baby I tried, yeah I tried
Let's put an end to this misery
Baby I cried, yeah I cried
So hot - stone cold, why'd you let me go
You got a heartless heart
Got a heart of stone
And it's just gonna bring you down
You tell me things that I know ain't true
Baby you lied, yeah you lied
I just wanted to be with you
You got a heartless heart of stone
It's bringing me down- baby
You had to play the only game you've known
With my heart- with my heart- oh

Somebody's watching me, is it just a crazy dream
Is it my memory, playing tricks on me
Out in the streets in the heat of the city
Here comes the night
Sky's turning grey and black
You knew that you were right
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
Just a shadow in the dark, you've seen this face before
Is it just a fantasy, is he coming back for more
Out in the alleyways, there is no second chance
Moving up behind you, you've lost the game at last

Total confusion- one final sin
Someone's religion and greed
Accidents happen, someone to blame
Who's got the answers we need?
I don't know who to believe
But I know who's gonna set me free
Cause I'll be waiting
When heaven comes down
Ashes to ashes, sorrow and shame
Look at the future again
Angels in heaven walking the streets
Searching for someone to blame
Until tomorrow
'Cause I'll be waiting

You weave your spell
Your eyes they beckon me
Your lips they speak, lies and misery
I know it's wrong, but I can't turn away
The flames draw near, they're telling me to stay
(Into the fire) I'm falling
Into the fire
Your love burns bright, and yet the flames are cold
This time I fear, you won't be back no more
When will it end, your love consumes my soul
Into the fire, I'm being tempted once more
Take me back where I came from
Don't wanna see your face no more
You broke my heart, now it's not the same
I'm falling, again

The shootin's over
The smoke is clear
Another notch in my gun
Another round of ammunition
Before the damage is done
She wanted this
I gave her that
She said she will
I took good aim
She felt no pain
When I started moving in for the kill
Cause I've got bullets
Bullets to spare
I've got bullets- bullets to spare
My barrel's ready
My hand is steady
Tonight I'm ready for fun
I got my finger
It's on the trigger
Another night on the run

I'd like to see you in the morning light
I like to feel you when it comes to night
Now I'm here and I'm all alone
Still I know how it feels, I'm alone again
Tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
I said stay, but you turned away
Tried to say that it was me
Now I'm here and I've lost my way
Now I know how it feels, I'm alone again
I tried so hard to make you see
Alone again

I'm like a wildcat at midnight
I'm like a stick of dynamite
Evil senses taking over me
Gonna let the action steal the night
Turn up the heat
Turn down the lights (action, action)
Baby go all night
Turn on the action
Turn on the night
I'm looking over my shoulder
I'm running reckless through the night
Forever young not getting older
Satisfaction guaranteed tonight

I've been lost in the middle
Always trying to find the wishing well
Running around in circles
Never crossing the line
Don't want to touch you
Don't want to see
You've got a knife in your heart
Don't say that you did it for me
Never unchain the night
Don't tell me that the love is gone
Cause there's always another turn
You know right where you want it
But you never gave it in return
Running me in circles
Always crossing the line
Leave you confused
You took the easy way out
When you looked through the eyes of a fool
Don't tell me that the love is strong
Never, never
I'm never gonna set you free

Clouds roll by as I look to the sky
And then the feeling comes, it comes on again
You know desire burns like a fire, fire of sin
Oh, will I ever learn
You're the only one I could call my own
But then the shadows fall and I'm gone again
I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for things
That I might never find again
Care for you, you know that I always will
I know it's hard for you, my taste for the kill
But then it calls to me when the moon rises full in the sky
You know it's not denied
Will I ever find love and peace of mind
On these streets again, will it ever end
You know desire burns like a fire, fire within
I guess I'll never learn
But when the shadows fall, you know I won't be home
Searching for the things

Toss and turn all night in the sheets
I can't sleep
Night after night don't know what it means
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away
In my dreams--it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams--you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
Calling your name, but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles, waiting to see you
In my dreams--you'll always be
In my heart and in my dreams
In my dreams--just the way it used to be
In my dreams--what can I say
In my dreams--You're still by me
And in my dreams--You'll always be
In my dreams--You'll always be
In my dreams--your love is strong
In my dreams--You're still the same

Like a whisper, you came in the night
Gone forever, seems you were right
Long ago, thought it was real
Should've believed love's not forever
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
Darkness comes, so cold
Gentle one, so soft and warm
I tried to touch you, I meant you no harm
Can't seem to hold one
Save me
Long ago, I thought it was real
I should've believed that love's not forever
I just can't hold on
Now that you're gone

The lights go down
You can feel it all around you
Like a razor's edge that cuts through the air
You can hear the sound
It's coming down like thunder
You don't have to tell me why
You don't have to care
When the lightnin' strike again
And the lights go down
And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again
You draw the line
And you leave it all behind you
You lost your mind and then you lose control
By the time
That you feel the lightnin' strike you
You know you've been holding back
You've got to let it go

Told you I had to leave, I had my reasons
I said that it hurt to stay, the way that I'm feelin'
It's not love
That left you standin'
That left you cold
Misunderstandin'
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take
Why, baby, why did you make me let you go
And leave you so lonely
Why, baby, why did you have to hold on
You know it's not love anymore
Gave you your last chance but you didn't believe me
You can't keep me satisfied, the way that you treat me
Why, baby, why, stop playing with my heart
I told you
Telling you to be this way
Sayin' you can never change
When I told you
Is he putting you down
Down, down, down

I didn't know you, but I could see it in your eyes
Shattered dreams and hopes, you'd been hurt too many times
Well I've heard your past from a friend I'd seen today
Told me of your heart, that you had been away
How I wish I could take you away
I would show you that my love's not the same
But I see I've found you too late
Jaded heart
You look but don't see
Love in front of you
You can't believe
Love can't get to you
To bring your heart to me
I realize you've heard it all before
Lies and promises, you don't listen anymore
How I hope that I will find a way
To break down all these walls that you have made
But my eyes see that it's too late
How I wish that I could take you away
Can it be that I found you too late
Jaded Heart

You didn't see me, but I overheard
A short conversation was just a few words
A lie and a whisper, a knife in my back
The things you were saying lead me to believe
You want no part of me
Leave me go, turn and walk away, turn your back on me
If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say
Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Like the way you used to do
Voices that whisper, dark deep despair
Burns me like fire, these things that I hear
Tell me it's over, don't tell me you care
Don't wanna hear it no more
Don't say you love me, if the feeling's not there
Just turn and leave me, I want no part of you
Or I'll be on my way
I won't be back again

In the name of liberty, we set off to the sea
In the name of glory, fighting to be free
But one mistake can set it all to rest
No one sees and no one wins the game of chance
I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise another day
A simple answer, that all of us should see
Let things be what they may be
Open your eyes, do you think that you're the best
Try to see the light before the final test
Will the sun ride, will there be a sky
Someone is watching, waiting to see
If there's a chance before the sun fades for eternity
Will the sun rise, I need to know
Will the sun rise
When it's over

It's too late to tell me you're sorry
It's too late to walk out the door
Last time, last time you left broken hearted
Only to come back for more
I'm not with you for love
You'll be back on your knees again
Til the livin' end
When will it ever end
You know I can't wait
Can't wait, til the livin' end
It was you that wanted affection
It was you and all of your lies
This time, this time I'm changing direction
Changing the look in your eyes
Got no hope for the future
When you live in the past
Not gonna wait for tomorrowWalking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law
I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive
So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight
Oh, I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha!)
I can howl at the rain (Ow!)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains
Love me tonight

Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Oh!
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!
I shall return from out of the... (Fire!)

Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
Oh, I'm running free
I spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free
Get out of my way, hey
Right?
Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah!
Oh
I'm running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah, yeah!
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah
Running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) yeah
Ow, ow! Ow, ow!

I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
Torture me back at your lair

The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh
Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old
Oh, baby
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a "fiver", it's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?
Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well, Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'Cause you're making love all day
Aw, 'cause you're making
Ooh
Ooh yeah

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought
Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
Just come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
I'm a wrathchild
Ah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh... yeah!
Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah!

I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Flee before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy
I'm running from the Gendarmes
I'm never coming home
Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of
Running from the arms of the law
Running from the Gendarmes
It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that inside my mind
Well, I've got to say I've done it before
They're never gonna find me
I'm never going home

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began
I'm running away, nowhere to go
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know. Yeah
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah

Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ooh, look out!
You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me
I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oh yeah, I've done it again!
Yeah!
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you!
Aha ha ha ha!
Oh! Oh!

Listen to me, Lamia, listen to what I've got to say
I've got these feelings and they won't go away
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees
Oh, help me, Lamia, or I'm sure I'll die, oh, please
I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be
I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please
Oh, Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh

Thinking of an age old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Is it me, I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led
Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!
Forever now, I can't think why
Or is it me, I just don't know
When you see me walking up beside you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away!

She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form
It's been three long years since I've been gone
I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
I'll never know the reason why I had to go
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?
I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone
Oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?

Walk away, yeah!
Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
Sitting here, think it's gonna be a new day
Gonna get my song and I can't go wrong
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song
What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song
Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh hoo
Ooh yeah
I keep on drifting
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah
I'm gonna sing my song, yeah
And it won't take long
I want you to sing along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
'Cause I'm a drifter
Drifting on
Yeah!

Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around
So be prepared – don't run – stand your ground
They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders... Pillaging!
Invaders... Looting!
Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders... Fighting!
Invaders... Marauding!
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle-weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
Invaders... Raping!
Invaders... Plundering!

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the Damned
He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought, "Oblivion? Well, it beckons us all."
Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?
Oh-o-o-o-o-ooh
You're children of the Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight

We want information, information, information
Who are you?
The new number 2
Who is number 1?
You are number 6
I am not a number, I am a free man!
I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feet
Goin' all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going – out!
If you kill me, it's self-defense
But if I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid of when I call out your name
Run, fight to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don't
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me

Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty six
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah!
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
666 the one for you and me
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?
A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail
Dead men, gangland
Murder, gangland
Tell no tales

Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who wasted her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice
Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Numbing our desires
Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
"Is this the end?" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm
Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun

I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God why has He let me go?
As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare

"O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride"
Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips
The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn
Go
Bind all of us together
Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
Still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you

As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God, my father, I fly"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave
Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
Fly

Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
If you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
13, the beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise
Terror, death, destruction
Pour from the eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands
They died, with their boots on
Yes, they died
They died, they died, with their boots on
We died, we died, we died, we died, we died

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

What ho said the t'ing with the three bonce, don't meddle with things you don't understand
Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me
Oh I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane
I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do
Oh they drain my strength away
Oh they're asking me to stay
Nightmares. Spirits calling me
Nightmares. They won't leave me be
All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool
Now I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear
Nightmares. Coming all the time
Nightmares. Will give me peace of mind
Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too
Oh we'll drown together
It will be forever
Nightmares. Forever calling me
Nightmares. Now we rest in peace

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Discovery of man
And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat
They searched all across the land

Well, you killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct, Animal supreme
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last – nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade and break you both
In two – break you both in two
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on
And it's rolling still

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it that you would die
In the desert the planet Dune
Without a still suit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the 'mice'
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'
He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars
The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down
You'll see he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men
And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
He'll make a stand
Against evil the fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout "Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers."
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun
Midnight
It's all night

As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men

He threw down a glove, you made the mistake
Of picking it up, now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance
Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Fight for your life
Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow
The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile, the reaper looks on
Oh, oh, fought for the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought for the pleasure
Fought to the death

Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole, and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Tables start to burn
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
But still, we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name!
Back in the village
I'm back in the village

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Slave to the Power of Death

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Slave to the Power of Death

If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?
Time is always on my side
Can I tempt you, come with me
Be Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go, would you be scared?
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be honestly
Just let yourself go
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong
Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally... let yourself go!
Caught now in two minds!

From the coast of gold across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
Out in the night somebody's crying
Of madness

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying, I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare
Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided
Oh oh
My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take
Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on
Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone and men again
They came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone
Trapped inside this prison

When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?
When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?
'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like I've been here before
Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before?
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged
'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

"My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee"
Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander
At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Became a legend amongst mortal men
King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia
Became a god amongst mortal men
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
He died of fever in Babylon

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die
One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep
Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end?
In Heaven or in Hell?
Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams
There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again

Can I play with madness?
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
There's no vision there at all
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)
He said:
He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see
I screamed aloud to the old man
I said "Don't lie, don't say you don't know"
I say "You'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next"
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said "You wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
"Listen to me," said the prophet

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn
You know, you know
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do

Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds
Seventh son of a seventh son
Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil, which path will he take?
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late
Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman, the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me?
Is it so hard to understand?
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends
Suffering and pain, impending disaster
Souls crying, the Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits
I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me
Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?
Purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, Hell awaits
I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late

Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?
I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
...and be reborn again?

The demon in your mind will tear you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
My fate is sealed
If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath
Your time will come
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
Brothers and their fathers joining hands to make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel
I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son

Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home
Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your soul to this brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world
Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt
There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted, which are you?
Diablo, come again
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus snap in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will, iron fist
How could it have come to this?

Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now? Is it really happening?
Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination?
I just can't take no more
The dream is true, the dream is true
Think I've heard your voice before
Think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
Coming to the realisation
That I can't see for sure
I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
To save me from myself
I get up, put on the light
Dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep myself from drifting
Saving me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost, a nightmare I retrace
Lost, a hell that I revisit
Lost, another time and place
Lost, a parallel existence

Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a Devil to get ready and take over your mind
You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the only one
I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
Beaten, fallen Angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no-one knows
Nomad, where you go to no-one tells
Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No-one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told
No-one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no-one's seen you kill
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius
Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
No man ever understood your genius
Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no-one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Withered hands, withered bodies
Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty
The punishment is death for all who live
Dreams of desolation
Come the Demons of creation
The killing fields, the grinding wheels
Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you
Before you know the crime, it's all too late

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
The thin line between love and hate

I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go
And I just feel I can be anything
That all I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I wanna be
Make my wildest dreams come true
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
Out on the road again
When I remember back to how that
Things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell
When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be
I'm gonna break away
I'm out on my own
Breaking away

When I was wandering in the desert
I was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives
Like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
To wash the tears
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away

There's a darkened sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me
Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me
A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No-one can stop me now
Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait till then
No more lies!
They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
But there's more things I have to do
Don't tell me that this is the end

I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocents, evil took place
The angels were burning inside
Centuries later I wonder why
What secret that they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion still burning inside
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free
The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan his weapon is lust
Living this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of life
The perfect would willingly have died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of god they had claimed
Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars and to die and be free

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me
And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures – they were undead – all of them
They had ascended from hell
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Have a drink and say a prayer for it
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead

Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights
To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead

Bleeding you dry from the start
The sum of my parts
To give it away
New life in a day
Some new Frankenstein
Damned for all time
Cursed by the angel who fell
Who saves me from Hell?
And who is my god?
And where is my soul?
Too tired to jump, too young to run
Never-ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man
I want to end my life now
But I don't know how
Recycled again, a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The Devil has planned

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years
Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon
Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
But the war, no chance to live again
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go
Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale
Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go
Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat
See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale

Everybody's waiting for something to happen
Everybody's waiting for something to see
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters
Everyone's waiting for news on TV
Winding lives at the end of the spiral
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill
Everyone's looking but no-one is listening
Everybody wants to be in at the kill
I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end of time
Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing
Everyone's looking for the reason why
Everyone's hoping for life ever after
Everyone's looking at death from the sky
Everyone's nightmares are going to happen
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes
Everyone's praying but no-one's believing
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies
I see the signs of the end
So I watch and I wait and I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all
And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war
So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low
You can't protect yourselves, even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals, they laugh right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace
Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore
And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
But the memory still remains
All the past years, not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun
Spare your life and you choose the destruction of time over yourself
Yeah!

Wanted man
Well, low dealer, with snake eyes
You cross me, you realize you're-
You're hot leather, you're cold steel
You make a move, I'll make you feel like a
Human target, in my eyes

You're in trouble, what are you gonna do
You're in trouble, it's what you're goin' through, goin' through
You're such a teaser, you give me life
I live in jungles and live with knives
There's always trouble on your mind
And won't you make me draw the line
And that's the price you pay to lie
You wanted trouble, you tell me why
We're gonna get you, what ya gonna do, do, do
We're gonna get you, what ya gonna do

You're in trouble, well, trouble, I got a finger on you
You're in trouble, It's what you're goin' through
You're in trouble

Out on the streets, that's where we'll meet
You make the night, I always cross the line
Tightened our belts, abused ourselves
Get in our way, we'll put you on your shelf
Another day, some other way
We're gonna go, but then we'll see you again
I've had enough, we've had enough
Cold in vain, she said
I knew right from the beginning
That you would end up winnin'
I knew right from the start
You'd put an arrow through my heart
Round and round
With love we'll find a way just give it time
What comes around goes around
I'll tell you why
Dig!
Lookin' at you, lookin' at me
The way you move, you know it's easy to see
The neon light's on me tonight
I've got a way, we're gonna prove it tonight
Like Romeo to Juliet
Time and time, I'm gonna make you mine
It's all the same, she said
Yeah!
With love we'll find a way just give it time, time, time, time
I'll tell you why, why, why, why

Well, I saw the time closin' in, you said you're leavin' me
I'm cursed with your heart's perfection
Well, said it's right to believe
Well, months and days, they slowly pass
I'm not waitin' for you
You turned me 'round in your direction
I'm lookin' for you, yeah
You spin me your way, in your direction
You pull me your way, in your direction
Well, city lights are shinin' on me
Well, said it's time to go
Abusin' you all across the country
Said I feel hot coals, yeah

Too many problems, the world can't solve
Too many people, no-one wants to be involved
(Lack of communication, back off)
Keep rearranging, it's all the same
Always saying, someone else is to blame
Look all around me, who's standin' tall
Hold tight, no-one's gonna answer your call
Put up our boundaries, we build our walls
It's alright, no-one's gonna change us at all
Time's passin' us by, we have our reason
No-one wants to try, we have our reason
Questions askin' why, we have our reason
Problems still arise, we have our reason... for
Back off!
You're so together, you fall apart
You never miss, when you're shootin' straight for the heart
You see it your way, I'll see it mine
Well, conversation is a useless change of line
Lack of communication
Well, back off, well, back off
In the age of the modern man
We see the problems, we don't really understand
Well, lack of communication
Back off, well, back off...
(Lack of communication, back off) [repeat]

You turn him away, you tell him you're mine
You make him believe you're but one of a kind
You give him a cold look, you tell him a lie
You turn him away, girl, you know you're mine
And you're back, you're back for more
You turn away, you're back for more
You gave him an inch, he took you a mile
He made you believe you're society's child
Then get in his new car, get in his style
I told you his way, he won't take you far

You think unkindly, simple not sane, know what I mean
Say I'm deliberately sent here to please
It's what you need, so I'm here tonight
You won't confuse me with somebody else
Look in your mirror, you're too good for yourself
It's all in your books, your magazines, can't you see
I'll be headin' out in time, if it's wrong or right
I'll leave the morning after [repeat]
Say I'm in to somebody else, know what I mean
I know you'll always think one of my kind
You're on my mind, baby, all the time
Lift your skirt, lady, high in the night
I'm just what you need, won't you give it a try
Don't put up a fight, it's gonna be alright, can't you see
Stay by my...
Solo
It's gonna be right, right out of the night
When out of the night, now, it's gonna be right
When out of the night, can't you see
I'll leave the morning, morning, morning,
morning, morning, on and on

Well, I'm off my rocker, I fell out of my tree
I've been standin' on shaky ground
There's no helping me, yeah
I can't remember my number
I can't remember your name
I can't remember all the trouble I'm in, child
Well, I'm insane [repeat]
You don't go looking for trouble
Well, I'm all the trouble you need
You don't go looking for bad love
You got it guaranteed, yeah
I can't see no colors
I can't play your games
I should've listened what my momma said, child
I'm insane [repeat]
You lock me up in a padded room
Chain me to the floor
Well, I'm headed for lobotomy
And I'm beggin' them for more
Well, I'm off my rocker, I fell outta my tree
Well, there's no helping me, yeah

I wanna rock, but you, you dared to roll
I came by your house, but you, you weren't at home
Well, I knock on your door, I hear you beg for more
You broke the law you see, and that's a felony
I think you've been caught (You have been caught)
At the scene of the crime (You have been caught)
At the scene of the...
Now I know what you've done to me
At the scene of the crime
Cold blooded bitch goin' out on me
I've got me a weapon, got me a loaded gun
You know I'll track you down
And you'll be on the run, no fun
You broke the law in the first degree
Now I know what you thought of me
Well, I know, well, you know, well, I know
Well, I know, well, your games
And I don't wanna play
Well, now I know what you thought of me
You've been out, and I've been cheated
Well, I've been lied to, again and again, again and again
(You have been caught) At the scene of the crime, yeah
(You have been caught) At the scene of the...

You take the midnight subway train
You're callin' all the shots
You're struck by lightning
You're in love
You take the evening one on one
You're only livin' to have fun
You want to use me, take me home tonight
I'll make you wish that you were mine
It's not worth fighting
Well turn around
Remember me
I'm the one
Who's out and aimed to please
You make your livin' lovin' hot
You spin me like a top
You take the evening one on one (On one)
You're in love (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well turn around (Turn around)
Remember me (Remember me)
(You take the midnight subway train)
(You're callin' all the shots)
(You take the evening one on one)
(You're only livin' to have fun)
(It's not worth fighting)

Hey!
I'm gonna make my statement
Don't need arrangements
I said you're not gonna make tracks
All over my life
When push comes to shove I'll be pushin' you down
Better think twice when you take that step
That you got both feet on the ground
Never use love (Never use love)
I don't want to fight
I won't get in your way
Don't give me the right
Never use love
I've gotta find my place
Don't need no replacements
When you think you're too much
Then I've had enough, hell yeah!

I know you don't really know me
I know you don't really care to see me
I'm into total affection
Not being scared if you never please me
You know you really want to lay it down
Right now
And how
I know you really want to lay it down
Lay it down
Under the sheets you will find me
I know that nothin's for free
You take what's good for your pleasin'
I'll take what's good for this crazy evening
"And I know you only want romance."
"I'll give you all that I can."
If you give me just one chance
To prove myself
In love
Yeah yeah yeah

Taken away on a ride not far from here
Well no wastin' time, she's got plans for me
She came behind and then showed me her thighs
You know what I mean
Well no way to say she could win the likes of me
The life of me
She said, "I'd like to wear you out
And give it all to you
I'll find a reason now
Just give it all, just give it all"
I want to give you all my love tonight (Give it all)
Just give a sign to me, I'll make it right (Give it all)
A fashion plate in a way, she really was
She had style and class understand she'll pay to dance
She moved my soul, don't you know she's here to please
Well I'm on my knees, can't you see, move in on me
Move in on me
Give it all (Give it all)
I said give it all (Give it all)
Hey!
(Give it all)

Ah!
I listen to you, are you listening to me
The way that you are, it's easy to see
Feelings for you, now I feel free
I'm lost in time
It's not the way that you hold me
It's not that I really care
It's not to say that to love is to own me
You're tangled up in my lair
You broke your promises
Fallen out of love
When you cross the line
You're one step closer to my heart
Closer to my heart
One step closer to my heart
Indecision, it's all been heard
No more confusion, the page has turned
Still with the darkness of the night
I always see the light
When you cross the line, then you'll find
That you're one step closer to my heart
(One step) Closer to my heart

I don't like your cheatin' misfit way
I don't stand for givin' it away
So you want some action, ask me why
You say you want to keep me in your target sight
Can't you see the world turn and hear the cries?
Can't you see you're burnin' me right between the eyes?
I don't like your hot and cold device
You know I'm the only one this time
Can't you see you're burnin' me between the eyes?
You hardly notice
I see you burnin' me between the eyes
I don't like your cheatin' misfit ways
Right between the eyes
(Between the eyes)

I make my moves
I make them right
I don't refuse
I keep it light
I take command
Of the scene
Because for me
There's no in-betweens
I keep holdin' on
Holdin' on through the night
'Cause it's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get
It's so easy to forget
What you give is what you get (What you get)
I take my time
And I don't care
This love ain't right
What's fair is fair
If you just ask
You will receive
Give me the task
I aim to please
It's so easy, yeah
What you give is what you get (What you get is what you get)

"Hello?"
Well cocktails for two, me and you
It's some fun hot afternoon
Whenever I'm alone
I sit and pick up the phone, give a call
She's so hot to have and to hold me
She said "I'll be your one and only"
I know what it means to be alone
Got me on the line
Ready for the night
You got me on the line
Now you'll think twice
You like your home sweet home all alone
You will be callin' me
I've heard the news around the town
You're not gonna hang up on me
Long distance kept me holding on
Long distance kept me holdin' on
Ready for tonight, tonight, tonight (Tonight)
Hey!
"Nobody hangs up on me."

My blood is thicker than water
I'm livin' out my life
I'll have my friends forever
We'll walk the sands of time
You should know by now
I never take no chances
Don't stand for compromise
I'll find the hidden treasure
I'm only passin' by
Can you hear me tellin' you (Tellin' you)
I've got something to say (Hey)
Don't you know it's nothin' new
Don't you get in my way, get in my way

Dangerous
But worth the risk
The things you do
To get your fix
You'll head for fun
You're on my list
Live for love
Will get you this
I know something, you know that it's true
I can feel it when I'm next to you
Dangerous but worth the risk
Your life's not threatened, but your lovin' is
The pressure's on
You're on the run
You're gettin' loose
You're havin' fun
Streets are cold
But remember this
We are dangerous
I know it's true
I know it's you
It's you
It's true

A streak of lightning is shooting through the air
Electric sun lights the sky
His face is frightening, so evil ones beware
Men of disaster hear his cry
And now at last we know he's real
The power of his sword we feel
Thundersteel Thundersteel
The earth it rumbles, death is in the air
The city crumbles, death is everywhere
And from the burning sky we see the soldier fly
He mounts his horse of steel and now he rides
The power of his word we feel
Men of disaster hexar his cry
Thundersteel Thundersteel Thundersteel

Ride out
The king he proclaimed 'cross the land
Tonight we strike against the enemy to capture their flag
Cry out
The tears that they shed for their brave
Tonight they ride with will, intend to kill who stand in their way
Across the fields
They march
Their task must be done
But in the end they know that this war must be won
Fight or fall
In the name of the children
In the name of us all
We can never surrender
In the night we stand tall
Rise up
Your swords for the souls you must save
Flashing of steel as your blades send them to their grave
Ride proud from the battle where many have died
And when the last is slain its into the distance we ride
We march
Our task must be done
But in the end we know that this war must be won

Oh god what have I done ?
In the shadows on the dark side
Neath the skies of crimson doom
In the streets I hear the wind cry
Evil sings the devil's tune
On your knees and pray for mercy
Let god hear us on this day
Or in the acid rain our bones will lay
Oh cry cry for a world that's torn
Cry for a child unborn
For it's the sign of the crimson storm
Desperate people in the city
Foolish games of greed and wealth
On themselves they have no pity
They are victims of themselves
Gotta make you pay for mercy
Oh cry, cry for a world that's torn
Oh god what have I done?

Thundering down, from the mountain you ride
Clutching a sword made of steel
The ones you call friends, they all left you for dead
Alone on the battlefield
Many were at your command
Renegade souls on the run
Holding each life in your hand
Living for all and for one
Shining, into the night you are riding
Through the darkness and light you are flying
With the wind in your hair
The flight of the warrior
Drunk with revenge from which on one can hide
Into their midst you will run
A face from the grave is the last thing they'll see
And die with your name on their tongues

I hear the call when the sirens scream
Into the night where an angel waits for me
She's lookin' bad she's a killer machine
I say the word and she explodes into light
Blinding power and rage
Players run to the stage
Screaming wings fill the silvery sky
Rising on pillers of flame
And we ride thundering into the sky
And we ride
On wings of eagles we fly
Full alert she is hot for the game
I sense my enemy and fire is the warning I send
A dance of death swirling miles above the rain
While mortals sleep angels swear to defend
I salute you my friend
Unafraid to the end
Devil take the high most
To hell with the rest
Now let the battle begin
Come on get up get out...
Heat seekers flash headed straight for your heart
One finds the mark and a fireball rocks the clouds
Men and machines sweet and deadly we are
We rule the wind on titanium wings
Plunging back from the chase
One more champion erased
I am the last and the plaster of my art
Until I am challenged again
Come on get up get out

What's the use of moving on
Maybe here's where I belong
I've had my fill of life's uncertainties
You think too much they say you're strange
They even raised the drinking age
This place has gone to hell since I've been away
But now this time I'll do it right
Yeah let's start tonight
Make the call and see who's still around
Don't look now, but Johnny's back again
I am your man
I paid the price, I'll take that slide again
Nothing stays the same
Tell the boys to step aside
Tell the girls to form a line
The king is back to claim the land again
Wanna fight? Let's get it done
Need to love, I am the one
Time to remember how we played the game
But now this time we'll do it right
Yeah let's go tonight
What the hell you've got to lose?!
Tell the boys to jump inside
Tonight we're gonna ride
It's time to show'em how its really done
You ever play - you never win
You don't even know what's happening
Until the end and then your race has run
This time we'll do it right

I was born on these streets years ago
I was the king of the neighbourhood
Fast on my feet, I was elite
I was the star of the show
This task must be done - I will not run
I will not lay me down to die
This war I will win, so let it begin
Deep in my heart is a burning fire...
I can't let it go
Alone in the night I know I must fight for my home
Time has changed the seasons
And I will go on with no reason
I feel my life slipping away
These streets are getting colder
And I am growing older
Tomorrow seems so far away
What's become of us friend, we were one till the end
Now I'm alone in the streetlight gleam
This town knew our names, but nothing's the same
The places I played have forgotten the dream

Whoever lives behind these walls got an appetite for pleasure
I've seen the trail that was left behind for broken hearts and buried treasure, arms and legs, hungry lips, and a grip of steel
One kiss and you live forever; that's one love you never wanna feel
Who's sorry now?
Should never go unknown
You made the choice, but you should've known
Run for your life
Run for your life, you've got to run
Nothing's gonna save you now
From the arms that cling and the jaws that bite
You've got to run for your life, from the kiss of death
Whatever walks behind these doors gonna eat you up alive
You want to run, but you can't resist; you know this lady's never satisfied
She's ready, ready for you with the ? to take you higher
One kiss, and you're defenceless; one bite, and your heart's on fire
Yeah, the thing wanna take you home tonight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

I awoke in the darkness
A ringing in my ears
In the cold and the silence
Feels like I've slept for years
Voices in the distance
Someone speaks my name
The sound of tears and laughter
Am I dead or insane?
I'm calling, no one can hear me
I'm calling, you know where I must be
C'mon let me out
You've got to set me free
Just to even hear
Ashes to ashes
Is that what he said?
More familiar voices
Lies about the life that I had
I wanna speak that I hear though
A realisation arise
A shovel strikes the earth above
I'm being buried alive
Hello! You've got to set me free
Doesn't anybody hear me
You've got to set me free, hey...
C'mon let me out, c'mon!
You've got to set me free!

It's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all
Stand up and shout
Let it out
You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again
You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire, go on, explode

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies
Life's a never-ending wheel, say
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah!
Oh what's becoming of me? No! No!
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy Diver, sole survivor
You're the one who's clean
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you, Holy Diver
Oh Holy Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Hmm hmm hmm

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white
Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail
You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy
Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin
So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right
So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Flying away in the clouds
You know you're losing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow
You can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle

Don't talk to strangers
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down
Hey, you, you know me
You can touch me I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see
Can you feel me?
I'm danger, I'm the stranger
And I, I'm darkness
I'm anger, I'm pain
I, I'm the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away, go
No, no, don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down yeah
Run, run, run, run away

Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all
Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel
And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found
Oh here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one never told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no
But here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
In the middle of the heart
Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right through your heart
And here it comes, here it comes again
Straight through the heart

If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there
She had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And in the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down
It said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away
He was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in mama's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said
You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible
Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and then I took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door
So I go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible
Go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible
I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
Disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me, you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I, we're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear
It calling you beware
Look out
There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark, whoa oh oh

Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
All right
And shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
And I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say, oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh Lord, just go the way you came again
Oh, shame on the night
So I know I'd better run
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh, shame on the night
Here I go, I've got to run
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Well, I lost my hold on the magic flame
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
[evil laughter fading]

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind can penetrate your mind
But sail on, sing your song, carry on
Cause we rock, we rock
We rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices, all giving choices
If we listen, they will say, oh we can find the way
But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
We rock, we rock
Sail on, sing your song, carry on
Ride out, stand and shout, carry on
See how we rock
We rock, that's rock

We're the ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness
That it needs, yeah
We're a laugh without tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming, home
We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never, come home
But the magic that we'll feel
Is worth the lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down
We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
Then quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line
Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies
Between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase
Is worth the pain
We're the last in line, oh
Yeah, we're off to the witch
We may never, never, never come home
Is worth a lifetime
You know we're the throw before the toss
But the only way to go is down
See how we shine
We're the last in
We're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're the laugh without tear
We're the smile without the mirror

You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
'Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn
You're breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, willing to learn

Alright
Dark touches, send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure
I hate the light
I speed at night
At night
Alright!
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've got some stairs to heaven
You may be right
I only know in my world
You've got some stairs to heaven you may be right
I speed at night yeah!
I speed at night night night night night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
I speed at night alright

Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But riders in the night
Can lift you out of sight when they call
That's all
My Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
Then someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
There's no day, no way
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come, steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch?
Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm the poor, I'm the sure
I'm the holy, I'm the pure
I can tell you tales
You just might not believe
One night, one night
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play for
One night touching pretty
But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light
One night
One night feeling pretty
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty in the city
One child went away
And one child stayed to play
Chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up
Where they fall, in the city

Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know, no, no
It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, they'll see you anyway
Evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, evil eyes
They'll follow forever
'Cause they're evil eyes
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes

Can you hear me?
Can you see there's a storm
On the edge of the sky?
Does it matter?
Well, it does to me
And I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder
There should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no-one sees
There is only the dark
Just imagine, will you try?
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine
Not what you want to see

Well, it's been a long hot road I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there, no, no
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light, all right
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out
You've been hungry all of your life, yeah
We speed across emotion
And then we lose our hold
We turn on wheels of passion
That we can't control
So eat your heart out
Run to the shadows and hide
All on fire then he dies, then he dies, then he dies

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine
Then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew
That the chains were on
My, my, my
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand
As it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me
And that's free but still
Your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still, your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
Oh my, the chains were on
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still, the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still, her chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on
The chains were on, the chains were on
Yeah, the chains were on
Seen them walking on the water
The chains were on
Seen them flying through the sky
My, the chains were on
Yes, the chains were on

Whenever we dream that's when we fly so here is a dream for just you and I
We'll fin the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heart
Oh here we see the wizard staring through the glass and he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie and the things you've got to do yeah

But oh sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night oh look to the light

And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heart
A shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack and he's looking right at you quick

And oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
Oh sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart yeah bleeding in the night yeah yeah 
We'll find the sacred heart

She's a rumor in the night it's crazy you can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light it's crazy but you go anywhere
It was just a summer night maybe when a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away maybe to go where where where
She crouches the hunter ready to tell you another lie another lie
You could see the side of someday feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway you were wrong wrong wrong
She jumped at the moment a chance to tell you another lie another lie another lie

You look and you know she's telling you another lie another lie another lie
Why it's crazy when you feel you're getting stronger another lie
Why it's crazy all the lies are getting longer another lie
Who oh yeah another lie another lie

It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door
She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar
The devil of one another
Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody broke a heart
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Without a friend
But they got Rock 'N' Roll
On the night that they cried forever

On the night that they screamed goodbye
They were lost in the dark
And they never returned

All's well at the midnight hour you're ready to fly
Don't think about the darkness or the rumbling in the sky
Somewhere on the morning road just waiting for you
Somethings that just could never be are calling up a spell so you can see yeah
Dream evil the dark that you find in the back of your mind dream evil dream evil
Don't go to the edge of rainbows don't close your eyes
Like things that can't be real the truth is really lies
Don't wish on a rising star you should open up the door 
Where things that just should never be are calling up a spell so you can see yeah
Dream evil the dark that you find can come out of your mind dream evil take you away

The night has a thousand eyes but he moves in only places where the eyes can never be
The night tells a thousand lies and when you wake up in the morning were you dreaming screaming
Tryin' to hide your burnin' heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman
Somebody start the game and the dark will just get louder as it shouts away the light
A shadow without a name but when he wakes up in the morning he just won't know was he a hero
Tryin to hide his burning heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman anybody can sunset superman
Tryin' to hide your broken heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman superman oh oh oh
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman oh oh oh
Anybody can anybody can sunset superman oh oh oh 

There's perfect harmony in the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness hunted by the lion and the lamb ah ah ah ah
We bring you fantasy we bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle or we will disappear never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away sailed away
We bring you beautiful we teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe or we will disappear never to return again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away they sailed away sailed away
And as we drift along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle and a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds and then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness just lost like them and part of all the pain that they feel yeah
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away leaving nothing nothing more to say all the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful and they'll always let you in
But doors are never open to the child without a trace of sin sail away

Two faces on fire no traces something has swallowed the night you know that nothing can make it all right yeah
Like candy emotion too much and sugar can turn to sand you scream but nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain or do we see just what we are we're naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children guns loaded take aim and blow all the dreams away too late for anything better to say hey
Are we just crazy with the pain or do we see just what we are we are 
Naked in the rain naked in the rain maked in the rain
Two faces no fire no traces fever has turned to snow hearts break to show you the way as you go oh
Are we just running from the pain or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children on fire emotion burns higher guns loaded blow all the dreams away
Naked in the rain naked in the rain frightened by the pain naked in the rain

Seems like heard this song at least a thousand times before 
He just wanted her but she wants more so build a wall keep it all to herself oh oh
Always never seemed to be too much reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains sad remains another victim of overlove overlove
He was just the devil in a thing disquise jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page close the cage on another victim of overlove
Overlove yeah overlove overlove overlove overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone and come the dawn you got another victim of overlove
Overlove overlove overlove love love love love overlove

Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back and everytime there's sunshine I'm blind yeah
I am everybody and everyone that I know is me everyone that I know won't see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer yeah
I'm another number and you know the numbers must agree but everytime the wind blows I can't fly why
We take away tomorrow and never see the end of today lock it up and send it away forever
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star 
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are I could have been a dreamer oh oh
Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back but maybe that was sunshine that I saw
I've heard about a rainbow I've heard it makes you crazy I think I'm goin' crazy crazy 'cause I see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer I could have been the one to fly
I always could have been a dreamer 'cause dreamers never die no
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer dreamer
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer

Give me shelter shelter I can face the day then I'll just fade away give me shelter give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly the fire starts to die you open up your eyes 
Faces in the window noises in the night
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window
We are evil and we are all divine creations of the mind we are pleasure
I see clearly who's behind the wall yes I can see us all
We're faces in the window noises in the night
Give me shelter shelter shelter give me shelter shelter shelter
Faces in the window noises in the night faces in the window hiding from the light
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window
When the fire starts to die and you open up your eyes there they are in the window faces in the window
We are evil and divine just creations of the mind and faces in the window faces in the window

Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move they're shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire burning through your brain turn to face the train oh oh
Hey it's magic said the mother to the child it's stronger than a smile let it go
When a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah when a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah
Just when you think it's pretend here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever maybe we'll still just never know oh oh
Stars move shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire magic shakin' all the earth when a woman cries
Oh oh stars move thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky when a woman cries
When a woman cries aah when a woman cries yeah yeah 
When a woman cries when a woman cries oh

Silence - we hunt for the queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between
Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play hey-hey
Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Silence - we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold
Oh to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more
More's been empty for years
Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you
Small gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon

Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do
The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spider
Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes
Now I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Don't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wild
Why do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hear
Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
A spider
Inside her

You've made it through another day
Driving past the backroads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you
Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun
We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in
Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
No pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel
Some friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my way
Scream at the crazy ones
Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you
Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again
Again, again, again...

I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night - black as heaven
So no-one saw the gun
Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back around
Clutching to monsters in shadows
I can disappear - gone
Better in the dark

If they take away your song
You can finally hear the voices
Of the ones that don't belong
In the face of the rising wind
We all sing Gloria
Is there flame without fire
Most unlikely
If you're there when the walls come down
We all sing - warrior
Is there sight without sound
But we got rock and roll
Rock and roll
Take me anywhere
Is there someone there
On the edge of the last goodbye
Ah the brave never die
Hey, send your heroes of to war
But whisper in their ear
Never cross the song police
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again
For the sake of the left behind
Soon forgotten by time
So unlikely
Cause we got rock and roll
Take you anywhere
Someone's always there
Bring me anywhere
Rock and roll me, ah

You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push
You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
Go on and push

He'd never tell her lies
And she believed in magic
But when the magic died
She could see that all along he's just been
Guilty - a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty - burn in fire
It's time to say goodbye
Don't tell another story
Another alibi
Now you see that all along he's just been
Guilty - you burn in fire
Guilty - the great pretender
You're guilty - just surrender cause you're guilty
Broken promise
But please forgive again
One more time for me
It's the very last time - you'll see
Guilty - liar, liar
You'll burn in fire
Guilty - just surrender, you're guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty
A liar, liar
Guilty - you'll burn in fire
Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire
Surrender - guilty
So guilty

Oh-oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness
Wakes the dead
Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder
And she's afraid
Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
I'll make you safe and warm
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is no more little girl
Don't see her anymore
They disappear
Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today I heard that she was dead
You can hear them only if you try
Goodbye

Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousine
Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio
But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall
Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no
Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall
Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine
And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah

Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the show
The same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son
I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old time
There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Will you need more?
Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh
Where would you be without music
You wouldn't be nowhere it all
You wouldn't be here to invest,oh
If you weren't in heaven no more
One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Well,thank fully we've got the boys
The melody lies fascinated
The rhythm is something divine
Send out a trend of impatience
To see you all movin' so fine
Got to find it soon

Man eatin' momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys
She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
You can take her if you want her you can
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline

Got no silver for my pocket
got no pillow for my head
and the winter it gets stronger
got to ease my aching head
In the morning when I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'm dying
Or I'll got out of my mind
I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my sense reeling
Knowing winter's come to town

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep
She was a cheater
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you
You are a cheater
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go...
This could be or last show
Changing dreams changing schemes... NEVER
We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should I give sorrow, or turn 'round and sneer
I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride
Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall
I can't go on
I, I, I, I...

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open minded,but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said i was there
Lead to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led
Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day,
Is this the way that you get your fun slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun,
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob.
You make me sick getting paid for murder,
But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her.
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds 'cause you won't go to hell.
Take your medal, wear it now with pride.
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside.

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Second to none

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight
Capped everywhere
I've held my licence
It came with birth,
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions
To the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Look around
They're moving in
Hold your ground
When they begin
We can do it
We can do it and if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United we stand one and all
So keep it up
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
[fade]

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
[repeat and fade]

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight
I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance
I'm gonna take
Gonna get out trouble and strife
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise
No I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties
No compromise
Wanna taste what it's like to be free
I'm gonna gather my things
Go through the door
Every night I'll live on my own
I'd like to be there
And I'm gonna be there
I got a will of my own
I go as I please
Fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When I need it
Then I'll ask for advice
[fade]

From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
At every wind what a stake we're in
Is pain better than the grave
When we talk without amend
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike
Kiss of Judas, spider like
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
But you don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm elected protective, detective, Electric Eye!

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light.
Glowin' god of Mars
Body burning bright.
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind.
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power.
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud.
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds.

I've been trying
There's no denying.
It's sending me
Out of my mind.
I've seen reason
Change to treason.
It's losing its sense
Of all kind.
How much longer will it take
For the world to see.
We should learn to live
And simply let it be.
Bloodstone, bloodstone.
In the night time
Wake in fright.
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played.
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made
Bloodstone.
I can't take it.
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that bloodstone.

I move away it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like I thought it would.
Help me, I'm beggin' you please.
You've got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life.
Leave me be.
Take these chains off
Take 'em off of my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave
I tried to run but I'm tied to you like a slave.
It's my fault for loving you so
You were so precious, how could I know.
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me.
I don't owe you anything
Why don't you get out of my life.
Through it all the memories cling
And I can't sleep at night.

I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go.
I've heard the rumours and it seems they're comin' true
do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new.
Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through.
How I suffer for your love.
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried.
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life.
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
You don't know what I like.
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messin' 'round, practice what you preach.
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive

Hey listen don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right.
They're playing at a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear.
Always takin' baby out that's o.k.
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me.
Told you one you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face.
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place.
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace.
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you 'round in the torture before the dread.
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter.
As the sweat is runnin' down your neck
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up.
Oh your heart is pumpin' gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load.
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line.
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake.
I don't talk about it but that's alright
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight.
If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate.

One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud.
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'.
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best.
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.

I'd spend my days alone
I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there.
Like I was in a cell
A captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair.
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control.
Down on the streets below
Bright city lights would glow.
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze
Still counting empty days.
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break the spell.
Fever.  You set my soul on fire.
Fever.  You fill me with desire.
Fever.  You always get it right.
Fever.  All day and all night.
Then one night as I walked
I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar.
Oh how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this.
So destiny has brought us
Oh so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream
At last I'll be with you forever.
And all at once it feels so right.

Hypnotize me
Mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip.
Light my fire
With cold desire
Losing all my grip.
Eat my diamonds
Drinkin' all my gin
Feast your eyes on
A whole lotta sin.
On no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no got your claws stuck in my
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child.
Took my dreams
And now it seems you're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre.
Stop pretendin'
Got me growin' old
Your tormentin's
Fit to snap my soul.
You took my heart
And left it blown to smithereens.
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh
And drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed.
Goin' under
Hear the thunder
Death defying grace.
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face.
Vivious talkin'
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised, so abused
I'm a human sacrifice.

When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you.
You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You Pulled me back to earth
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future
Will you ever set me free
Take me into your arms again
In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain.

Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in
Never stops the Way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
You'll find there's life with victory
With victory on high
Freewheel burning [x8]

Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode - Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down
Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
All your life
Tough as steel
Stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
All your life...

Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figure's primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemned to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives
Now facing one another
The stand-off eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown

When you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise
That's when I crawl
Gliding on mist
Hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss
Evils abound
In the dead of night
Love bites
Into your room
Where in deep sleep
There you lie still
To you I creep
Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend
You smile as I sip
Now you are mine
In my control
One taste of your life
And I own your soul
Softly you stir
Gently you moan
Lust's in the air
Wake as I groan
Love bites you
Invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you
Delights you
It drains you to white
You knew at first sight
You'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite
There'd be no turning back
So come in my arms
I strike any hour
I will return
To trap and devour
Love bites...

Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
And eat me alive
Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver as
You give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as
The rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive

You can look to the left and look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights-flashing colors
Sleepless nights...
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks who are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
And slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day burning hell fire
You're blown away...
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
And the man with the power
No! No! ...

In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days (yeah)
That's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
And there's nowhere to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Then I will wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
And there's no place to go
Oh no!
You won't be there tomorrow
Say it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
And there's no place to go...

I know you like it hot
Love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside ya till the power splits your head
We're gonna rock ya till your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with an iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
So come on let's tell the world

Why do I have to wait so long
Before you come into my life again
Seems as though forever until
I can be here by your side till then
I think you feel the same way too
You know you make my dreams come true
If you'll just turn on your light
Let me see it shining through the night
When I'm far away from here
I'll hold all the memories so clear
If I only have the choice
I would stay so let me hear your voice

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one

When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimensions
It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling
Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings
Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision
An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
Your gonna get richer, I gotta get wild
Any time you want to
Any way you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Live that fantasy
I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane late at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light
You know where we're going
I know where we are
Set the rear view mirror for the backseat of the car
In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you
When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotised
Never seen nothin' like it no,
You won't believe your eyes
Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean
Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling to the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar
Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound
Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night
Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on
Do you love it loud

Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more the pain you'll feel
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice
Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
so expect the worst
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry, is victory, is victory

As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting
Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice
Not begging you
I'm telling you
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night
They're closing in
They'll never win
You won't make me,
As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down
just I'll face you under
Hands of justice
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear

The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me
And carved out of stone
I've broken hearts
Made people sing
I've drove a million miles
I've done everything
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
And no one can take that away
Bring on the night
That's when I live
I come alive inside
Give all I can give
I live each day
Like it's my last
I live for rock and roll
I never look back
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

The greatest times, I've ever known

And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

You get me up, then we both get down
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds
I'm all tied up on your bed
I'd rather be inside your head
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back
Then you ease off with your attack
You're the best I've had if you please
You never stop, you great big tease
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show

It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all
corners of the land
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of
hand
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Impossible to stop
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in
awe
At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for
And millions roared, and millions cheered
This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore en-captured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Pain! Pain!
Killer! Killer!
Can't stop the Painkiller!
Pain!

Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road
Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol
Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground
Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you
Crome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All Guns, All Guns Blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
With a burning heart
Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
No-one survives
Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground
High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing lazer
Burning glaze
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud
It's comin' - Meltdown
Start runnin' - Countdown

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Force rises
False rituals
Baptises
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
The burning sermons consecrate their sin

You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
You're possessing me
In the night please set me free
I can't resist your Touch of Evil
A Touch of Evil
Touch

Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins
Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see
This day will last forever
Deep in the hearts of men
Courage and victory
Remember, remember
One Shot At Glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire
Fighting on with dignity
In life and death we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel
I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
Fight fight fight
Fighting the world every single day
Fighting the world for the right to play
Heavy Metal in my brain
I'm fighting for Metal 'cause it's here to stay
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting the World
I been fighting
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight
Now people keep asking if we're going to change
I look'em in the eye
Tell'em no way
Stripes on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel not clay
See my brother standing by my side
Only got one thing on ever mind
Radio's playing this nation wide
Turn it up louder till we all get fright
Fight - Fighting the World

Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.
What's goin' on now
Don't ya care about me?
Send the same letter to the radio, Ha!
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head
We all like it - Rock And Roll
We all want it - on your show
Play it loud  don't play it low
Blow Your Speakers with Rock And Roll
We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'
People want music to get'em movin'
We don't want labels
We want music on the cable
We want it
We got lotsa stations

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Always Carry On

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me
Are you ready?
Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man
Violence and Bloodshed
Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me
My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end
Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent
Father, father, father
I look up to you and heed thy call
This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be

Damnation, Religion
Salvation, Fire and Steel

I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere
Holy, Holy War
Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Baptized in Fire and Steel
For the end we bring is soon
Now face the storm
A Holy War
Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Black Dogs howl in the night
The Lion is dead!
A Solitary Messenger
The Master of Revenge

Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.
I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Wheels of fire ride

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes
We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down
other bands play Manowar kill

Built a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind, born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise
With fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come

But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

Brothers the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the Battle Hymns
Into Glory Ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're Fighting the World
Side by side
On a crusade
The world we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king
Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France
Will not fail
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy
Switzerland, Austria
Back to the Glory of Germany
Sound the Death Tone
On our March for Revenge
Spill the Blood of my Enemies
The Oath of a Friend
Fight the Holy War for The Crown and the Ring
Six magic circles made by the Blood of the Kings
Wherever we ride it's metal we bring
Blood of a king.

[PRELUDE]
[I HECTOR STORMS THE WALL]
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
[II THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS]
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
[III FUNERAL MARCH]
[IV ARMOR OF THE GODS]
[V HECTOR'S FINAL HOUR]
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
[VI DEATH HECTOR'S REWARD]
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Die, die, die...
[VII THE DESECRATION OF HECTOR'S BODY]
[PART 1]
[PART 2]
[VIII THE GLORY OF ACHILLES]
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers go on get out
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers I said
There's metal in the air tonight, can you hear it call
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky

The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.
Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me
When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die
Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave
There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind

In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring

Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die
Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine
We are the undefeated we're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel
Livin hard and ridin fast
No one controls our goddam lifes

Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son

In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky
From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion it's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight
We believe in the power and the might
We're here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

Some want to think hope is lost see me stand alone
I can't do what others may want then I'll have no home
So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage ride into the night
Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul will point the way to victory
If there's a fight then I'll be there, I'll be there
So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Lift your wings up high my friend fearless to the end

We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king
All of the dreams held deep inside have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king

I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell

When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
[Repeat 3, 4, 5, chorus to fade]

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
[Repeat chorus]
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song
[Repeat chorus to fade]

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
[Bridge:]
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
[Chorus:]
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
[Repeat bridge, chorus]
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
[Chorus:]
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
[Repeat chorus]
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived
[Repeat chorus, 2nd verse, chorus]

Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
[Repeat chorus]
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
[Repeat all]

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
We know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia

Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you

Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now

Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Now your ships are burned
And the evil has returned
It will creep upon you
There's nothing to do
It will rip up your mind
And death you will find
Life is just a game
And death is just the same
Within the blood stained walls
In the center of your brain
Demons without mercy
Driving you insane
When the Orders are obeyed
And you have been slayed
You're lying on the ground
Without making a sound
As your soul fades away
You can hear someone say:
Ring the dooms day bell,
Turn the world into hell!

There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Because I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me
I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side
I'm trying to fight
For what is right
But evil spirits pass me by
They do what they want
They just don't care
What you feel or what you say
Where the road is leading us

No... No!
I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars
Who's to run and who's to fight?
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die
Who's to lose and who's to win?
I'll see the light tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life tonight!
Now the chaos has begun, people crying out
You're all alone, you gotta run!
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide
No we never had a chance!
No... Oh Oh Oh Oh!
Take my life tonight

You say the end of time is coming far too near
My love for life is torn in vain through all the years
What's the answer to the question
that we have been searching for
Can you tell?
Don't wanna fall apart before we have a chance
to try again
Don't let it end...
I tried so hard to make it right for you and I
Your sacred promises have all become a lie
Is this your idea of destiny?
'Cause if it is, just set me free
You can not fool me with your stories being told
My God it brings me down, I feel I'm growing old
No, please don't end it now, there is so much more
We can do, you know...don't let it end...
Let's gather what we had and build it up, again
It used to be so good, oh, please don't let it end

In the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall openIn the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall open

Oh Yeah!
I am a Viking I’m going out to war
I've got death upon my mind
As I was leavin' oh yesterday
I've got no fear in my heart
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through the waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah!
I am a warrior my mind is set to kill
Life or death is on the line
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel
I've got your life right in my hand
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah yeah! yeah!
You are a loser and it's such a shame
That you're a fool and you don't know
That I’m a Viking I'll walk all over you
And by my sword you will die
Dragon ships are charging through those waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah…yeah!
No No No… No!

No more will I do all the things that I've done
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find
His soul had wandered through years of despair
Eyes without expression told to beware
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high
To find they're forgotten to rest and to die

Outcast, not knowing right from wrong
Surrounded by women, wine, and song
Never still always on the run
Prince of the night, killing with a gun
Now, he's taken a life away
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay
Renegade, he fled from town to town
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down
For his head, lies a might price
He's a wanted man, dead or alive
Where will he go from here
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...
He's got mixed emotions running through his head
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead
He's on the run, again
Tell me when will it end

Now the battle is over, the clouds're hanging low
Dead bodies lie on the ground
Marched into slaughter, lost souls fought in vain
No glory or pride to be found
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around
Trying to find my way home
Fighting for honour and medals of gold
But, they were to kill or be killed
Slaying the enemy, not knowing why
Keep low and fire at will
Lost out in action, long gone forever
Just a boy that died in vain
His mother is crying, his father not proud
Twisted gray faces in the rain
Trying to find my way home...

Just an ordinary day, all around it seems O.K.
With a normal view
Then you open up your eyes, suddenly you realize
Everyone's confused
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be
Everyone around is sad, but, they analyze you mad
Sayin' you've lost your mind
Seems their lives have been abused
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find
Seems the whole society in the world's insanity

It was you, it was me,
And we would last forever.
Any fool could see, that we were 
Meant to be
Without you, there is no meaning to
My life.
You're gone and it cuts me like
A knife.
How could you leave me?
You don't remember, I'll never forget
You just don't remember, I'll never forget.
Why did you turn away,
Let your love fade away and die.
You became so cold, you made me feel
So old.
When you left, you broke my heart
And just to see.
How many pieces there would be,
After you leave me.
You just don't remember, I'll never forget

You came to me
You said you were my friend
I shared my art and my mind.
You found it easier
To steal than create.
Then call it your's, though it's mine
You can't fight, what is right
Face the truth, liar
You can't feel, you just steal
You smile in my face,
When I turn around,
You stick a knife in my back.
You think you're clever,
You know you're insane,
You're lies are not white they are black.

They all were there, the court was full
The king beside his queen
His love was cold, the fool will dance
for her 'till end of time,
The queen is in love,
The queen is in love.
She couldn't help her burning heart,
And now he's burning too.
Their love was blind,
They will dance until the end of time.
Queen is in love
The furious king now has learned
He sentenced them to burn.
Forever one,
They are joined in death eternally

I now will tell you all a story,
That no one ever heard before.
It is the tale about the fury,
Remember wisdom is your strength.
It said you're such a fool
Just let my evil rule
No, it's burning like a flame,
Now nothing seems the same.
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
It's wish is my command.
Enslaved forever by the fury,
By the fury, no!
At first it came to me in visions,
And that was filling me with pain
And when my fear became desire,
To let the demon burn my soul.
It said "Don't fight in vain,"
"I'll make you love the pain."
I now have told you all my story
And still for you its not too late.
Don't draw your sword
Just use your wisdom
And never let this be your fate.
Oh, no it's here again,
This demon loves the pain.

Born with the fire in my blood,
Can't live without it.
Something that gold can never buy.
It doesn't matter who you are,
Or what your thinking,
If you believe in what you try.
Feel the fire,
Your burning desire.
Fire, I'm burning up with fire
Fire, feel it burning higher
If you are rich, or if you are poor,
There is no difference,
It's still in what you're fighting for.
If you are strong you will survive,
You'll feel the fire,
Burning on forever more.
Feel the fire
Your burning desire
Fire, I'm burning up with desire
You never play with fire.

Everyone is searching for the
Meaning of our life.
Reading 'bout the hell and heaven
Believing all those lies.
Look upon yourself
Imagine you are two
Power lies within this is true.
Can't you see its clear like a mirror
It's all within what you're searching for
Magic mirror, magic mirror
Now your eyes are open,
and you know you were a fool.
You always had the power,
But you never broke the rules.
Power lies within this is true
Magic mirror, Magic mirror
Once again I say,
The strength that we are all searching for,
High and low we all looked in vain
Can't you see, it's clear like a mirror.
It's all within what you're searching for.

In the time, when darkness ruled
No one saw the light
In the cold black emptiness
Victims of the night
You can't fight what you can't see
To be or not to be
In the dark ages
Those evil days will still remain,
Till someone breaks the chains.
Just the strong survive,
You have to try, or you will die.
In the Dark ages

Out of the darkness, the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong
The lightning, strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I hear a rising force
Searching my soul, now I find something else
I take my life in my hands
Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The power is at my command
The lightning strikes, cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
I feel a rising force
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
The rising force starts to shine
A burning inferno, it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind

Look at me, see the love that you're missing
Can't you see that I'll always be there
You can't run you can't hide from the feeling tonight
Damage done. I guess love isn't fair.
Sometimes I wonder who you are
So close, but we've gone too far.
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl.
Lonely days, fill my nights with such sorrow
Shades of grey, turn into blue tomorrows.
Sometimes I wonder where you are
So close, but your eyes are so far.
You're gone and I can't go on and now my heart cries for you girl.

Lost in a dream in the arms of the night
Two lonely prisoners of our own device
Don't let me go. Hold on together
You wanna know if love can be real
I wanna take everything I can steal
Love on the line, it's now or never.
Why can't the night last forever.
This could be Paradise
Holding you here by my side
If we just close our eyes
We'll be in Heaven tonight.
Run through the night down streets of desire
Burning my soul, my heart's on fire
Give up the fight, it's sweet surrender
With trembling hands we reach for it all
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall
I need you now, now more than ever.
This feels like Paradise
I see the world in our eyes
If we just hold on tight

Shades of night, fall upon my eyes
Lonely world fades away
Misty light, shadows start to rise
Lonely world fades away.
In my dreams your face is all I see
Through the night you share your love with me.
Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.
Here we are on the crossroads of forever
Shining star lights the way.
Walk with me on the winds of time
Love's mystery is for us to find.
Until that day, until the day I find you
I won't rest, I won't let go
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you
To warm my heart and fill my soul.

Locked up in chains, backs to the wall
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call
Pushed from outside, thrown underground
Frozen in time we wait for the sound.
Oh, I feel something coming
Looks like a riot in the dungeon.
Trapped behind bars, prisoners of death
All hope is ours, we can't give up yet
Ready to fight to get what we need
Die on your feet or live on your knees.
Looks like a riot in the dungeon
You stand and die or start your running
'Cause there's a riot in the dungeon.
It's got to give, it's gonna break
Dying to live, our freedom's at stake
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood
We won't give in till they've had enough.

I always knew, somewhere in time
We'd meet again, we'd cross that line
Don't need to question, no reason why
The answer lies before your eyes.
Do you know who I am
Do you understand?
Deja vu, dreams come true
I see my soul inside of you
Deja vu, so many lives
Familiar spirits behind your eyes.
We cross between worlds through windows of light
With open arms we hold back the night
The crystal of power we hold in our hands
We go on forever and love is the plan.

We hold the secret to a dream
We keep it wrapped in chains
Locked inside a mystery.
We climb a stairway to the stars
Through doorways of the heart
Step inside, the magic starts.
Gaze into my crystal ball,
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.
You veil your eyes in fantasy
Time to pull the curtain back
Distant worlds, so much to see.
I wanna know you, come on let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you, reach out to these hands of fate
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

Hold on tight in the heat of the night
Baby there can be no escape
Feelings right, getting hard to fight
Baby how much more can I take.
Tell me that it's real, everything you feel
What am I supposed to do
Look into my eyes, touch me deep inside
Let me feel your love cut through.
Oh, now is the time
Feeling your heart so close to mine
Oh, I want your touch, need you so much
Now is the time for our love.
Drowning in the flames, in the sea of desire
Angel with the devil's eyes
Turn up the heat and we fall in the fire
Can't you feel the temperature rise.
Tell me that it's true, you can feel it too
Let me be your fantasy
Baby hold me tight, say that it's alright
You know you can count on me.
When the fire starts I can feel you burning tonight
With an open heart baby won't you let me inside,
Let me inside girl.

Step inside the dream machine
You're on a power drive
Feel the passion of the beast
Watch her come alive.
Oh, you're almost there, ride on silver air
You better hold on tight, she's fire in the night.
Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.
Got your hands upon the wheel
The pedal to the floor
Now it's time for nerves of steel
Hear the engine roar.
Oh, you shoot the thrill, heading for the kill
No control tonight, she's liquid dynamite.
Rev it to the Red line
You're tearing up the street
12 cylinders and she's all mine
She's too tough to beat
Oh, you shoot to thrill 
Heading for the kill
No control tonight
she's liquid dynamite

To be lonely is my only trust
In my silent movies 
I can expose my lust
Taking snapshots in the light
That I do recall when I retire
Playing with my fantasies I let the curtain fall
In my desire
Still I need that touch for real
To discover and to feel
You're the one that breaks my heart
And it's tearing me apart
Making love to you baby
Making love it's all I want
Making love
Every subway-every crowded street
Feeding my emotions
We pass but never meet
My touch is two dimensional
I slowly close my eyes and think of you
More or less invisible
Still you're my point of view
I can't get to you

Come on baby, what's on your mind
You're stumbling in the darkness
Like you're running blind
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
This same old graveyard
on the same playground
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round

Once we were one 
Now we're worlds apart
Deep inside you know you are my other heart
My memories seem like yesterday
Can't believe it's all so far away
All these years
All our tears
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
You said to me
That we hold the key
Eternal love we give and take
It was meant to be
My love for you
Was always true

With your love you gave me life
Not knowing right from wrong
You always know that I'll be strong
You set me free and you paid the price
You inspired me in my art
With the rebel in your heart
You gave nothing for nothing
But the spirit of you word happiness could bring
I learned to always do the best I can
You taught me to be true and I never ran
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Left all alone in the cold
Nowhere to go so I run like the wild
Stumbling, falling
Crying calling you...
As they gave nothing in return
You became their slave although you were brave
You still teach me what is left to learn
Though they brought you to the grave
You will remain to ease my pain

Don't ever try to fool me
Cause I can see right through you
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
Hold me, feel me
Wound and heal me
Mend this broken heart
Though you're near me
You can't hear me
But you tear my soul apart
I can't beat you
Can't defeat you
You just make me cry inside
Don't even try to fool me
My rage is growing stronger
And I can't wait no longer
Never learning
Vengeance is burning
Deep inside your mind
Time will come to
When I'll make you
Stumbling like blind leading the blind

I cast my pearls before the swine
Sealed and delivered
Then I drink your toast of wine
Though it's bitter sweet
I'm eating from you hand so neat
Pennies from heaven
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live 
Judas...Judas
Sightseeing through the lights
and shades of you mighty colonnades
No I got the picture
of the beauty and the beast
I am the lamb...you are the priest
To crucify me
To make a living...Makes no difference
Friends, you are what you do
Some are false and some are true
You haven't got a clue
I'd rather reign in hell some said
Than serve in heaven

I was carried to you
By the hands of my fate
Thought it was too late
I wasn't the type that believed in true love
At first sight
you changed it to the right
I know what I feel
This is real
I give you my body and soul
Let your resistance drop
Don't have to stop
By the siren's call
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I'm not the type to believe
in a second chance
Or in sweet romance
I'm no beginner been fooling around before
Still coming back for more
Today is different
It was meant
I've found a reason
There's more than one season
Time to think it over

My one way ride in dead end street
Leading to victory and glory
You seek I hide you'll find defeat
My future's in the hands of fury
You try - but never win
Can't you see I am the demon driver
Don't lie it is a sin
Cuz you know I am the demon driver
I live to drive and never wait
For guardian angels riding by me
To speed or die I'm never late
Wherever you are there will be

Something deep inside, far from reality
We pretend it never crossed our mind
we feel but never sense
Building up a strong defense
Some say it's our destiny, Lord...
We're living on the faultline
Get out of here
Cry the prophets of our time
Fear the signs
Save those you love and all your children
You life depends on castles in the sand
Don't look back there is no promised land
We don't want to hear that this could be the day
So much for science fiction
as you always say
But soon the day will come
It's only just begun
For the people on the faultline
it's no use to pray
Why living in danger
Why living in danger, danger

Can't bow for a rule
Cause I'm nobody's fool
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win
Sometimes I might be rude
Acting in my mood
I'm trying to be straight
Cause I don't want to be late
There's nothing you can say to make
me feel worse than I do (how are you)
You can't buy my freedom
Keep me locked in your cell
Sad how we waste our energy
When all our days are few (makes me blue)
We're two of a kind me and you
I guess that I'll see you in hell
Who is my friend
Who will remain
Seems like I always stand alone in the end
Nobody lasts until the end
You can't buy my life and freedom
It's more than just buy and sell
You can't keep me locked in your cell
See you in hellAre you feeling the fire, are you ready to explode?
Are your dreams and desires riding down an open road?
I'm like a runaway, a heart without a home
Others can laugh and play
I'll fight for every inch I take, I'm desperate to the bone
Stay hungry, feel the fire
Stay hungry, don't explode
Stay hungry, with desire
Stay hungry, you're alone
Be the hunter and the hunted, keep your target in your sight
Don't be side tracked or shunted, let pretenders feel your bite
And if you start to slide never show you're weak
Don't feel you've got to hide
Remember what you're fighting for, remember what you seek
Alright
If your fire is faded and you can't feel it no more
If you're tired and overrated, let me show you to the door
Expect no sympathy, there's none to be had
Open your eyes and see
There's no room for the wannabees, the has beens or the bad
...

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We've got the right to choose and there ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be just, don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong
Oh, you're so condescending, your gall is never ending
We don't want nothing, not a thing, from you
Your life is trite and jaded, boring and confiscated
If that's your best, your best won't do
We're right, yeah
We're free, yeah
We'll fight, yeah
You'll see, yeah
No way!
We're not gonna take it (no!)
We're not gonna take it anymore (just you try and make us)
We're not gonna take it (come on)
No, we ain't gonna take it (you're all worthless and weak)
We're not gonna take it anymore (now drop and give me twenty)
We're not gonna take it (a pledge pin)
No, we ain't gonna take it (on your uniform)

Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in child, take my hand
Here there's no work or play, only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say as you go down, down, down
You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire, but I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn
Before I burn in hell
Take a good look in your heart, tell me what do you see
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late
And then you'll burn in hell
Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you (oh, burn in hell)
Lay no evil down on me (you're gonna burn in hell)
Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you (oh, burn in hell)
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free
See no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free (you're gonna burn in hell)
...

Oh, it's so nice to see you all inside my dreamy little world
And it's so nice to be with all you lovely little boys and girls
Make yourselves comfortable, my place is so divine
Don't you think I'm wonderful? Say yes! You're on my time
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Don't try to leave, the doors are locked and only I have got the key
Forget the windows, they're nailed shut and boarded up so you can't see
You'll love the light show, oh, I'm sure you'll think it's swell
When they go off, you're welcome to my living hell
Come here, my sweet
Let me help you with that
There, that's better
I'm overjoyed at all the games I'm playing here with you today
But I'm so sad the party's over and we can no longer play
You think you're going home to your own little bed
But that's impossible, you can't sleep when you're dead
...
It happened in the broad daylight
So unexpected came the knife
A child's scream sliced through the air
But no one came or seemed to care, no!
The man's description did little good
A local stranger from the neighborhood
Those little kids, oh, he left behind
With their mangled lives and their tortured minds
Since he didn't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair
Call for street justice
Let no mercy show
Don't let him go
The man was caught and brought before a judge
Who had just returned from a three drink lunch
His lawyer screamed "you must set him free"
And off he went on a technicality
Since the law don't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair
Why should parents cry?
How many have to die?
The mob assembled, smoke filled the air
And marched in anger to do what's fair
To bring to justice this soulless thing
And show the others what evil brings
Now before you shake your head, think if it was your child instead
Tell me what you'd do
Pray this isn't true
When slime escapes the law
We'll even up the score
Please don't let him go...

I wanna rock! (rock)
I want to rock! (rock)
Turn it down you say
But all I got to say to you is time and time again I say, "no!"
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to when you tell me not to play I say, "no!"
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you
There's a feelin' that
I get from nothin' else and there ain't nothin' in the world that makes me go!
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
Turn the power up
I've waited for so long so I could hear my favorite song so, let's go!
When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me
There's nothin' else that I would rather do
Rock (rock)
I wanna rock!
...

How long I have wanted this dream to come true
And as it approaches, I can't believe I'm through
I've tried, oh, how I've tried
For a life, yes a life, I thought I knew
Oh, it's the price we gotta pay and all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose, though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done
Time seems to have frozen but the mind can be fooled
As the days pass I discover, destiny just can't be ruled
Hard times, oh, hard times
For the prize, yes the prize, I thought I knew
...

Look at you, you're my dream
Are you all that you seem?
Now you have what I need, and what I believe
Don't tell me you'll lose it, 'cause I'll have to leave
Don't let me down
What do I have to give
Until you let me live?
You're all that I work for but that's not enough
Do I have to die too to show you my stuff?
Well, I give you my best
So, why don't you understand?
I'm passing the biggest test
So, don't cry, lend a hand
Head held high, heart in hand
Flesh and blood, make a man
If that disappoints you, well, what can I say?
I don't want you to hurt, I just want to play
...

You can hear the thunder long before the storm
But you can't hear the lion when he stalks his prey
He's moving like a shadow, creeping up on you
And like a siren's call he's gonna have his way
You'd better run, forget your pride
Don't make a stand, just step aside
If you don't have what it takes, don't try to play, you'll lose your stakes
Remember this at least
It's the nature of the beast
You won't hear a footstep comin' up on you
Movin' like a snake he's in complete control
This killer knows his business, he is the predator
You are his only target, you're his only goal
What will you say, what will you do?
Your wildest nightmare's comin' true
There is nothing you can say, no way to change, he won't delay
This cain will have his feast
If you play you're bound to lose
Don't roll the dice, don't turn the screw
Just listen to the priest

Black sheep of the family, nothing like the rest
Separate from the others, failing all their tests
Can't they see you're different, so hungry and so lean
You're a walking wonder, you're a metal machine
Look and you'll see you're a lot like me
You're an S.M.F.
You're an S.-M.-F.
Caught up in their worries and tomorrow's dream
Missing all the living, milk without the cream
They think you're so foolish, living for today
Caring just what you think, not what others say
Join with us, oh, how they'll scream and fuss
We're the ones that live it, we're all really free
And if they think that we're sick then sick is what we'll be
Scream it loud, Know what you are, be proud

Gather 'round us, join with the band
Together we're stronger, together we'll stand
Say what can you do, well, we've got a plan
And we're gonna take you to the promised land
It's time to remember, it's time to move on
They've pushed it too far, they don't know what they've done
If it's a fight that they want then it's a fight that they'll get
We never lose, honey so place your bets
Long ago and far away
We had a voice, you know that we had a say
We won't live for yesterday
Ready or not, we're gonna have our way
We got the numbers, yeah, we got the might
We got the strenght and we got the right
We got the reason, yeah, we got the night
So wake up the sleeping giant
Not one more minute, not one more day
We've waited too long, can't let our chance slip away
We won't stop 'til we get it, we won't stop 'til we're done
We'll bite and we'll claw until they've lost and we've won
We took all we're gonna take
It's got to stop, you know there's too much at stake
Who the hell are they to say
What we can do and how we can play
Whoa
Wake up the sleeping giant
Let's push to the limit, so let's push 'til we're home
We've been good too long, they wouldn't leave us alone
It's our rights they're abusing, it's our right to fight back
So rally the troops and let's start the attack
We got the numbers, you know we got the might
We got the reason and we're ready to fight

Oh know, that girl, she's lookin' so fine
I know she knows ,what she's doin' to my mind
Ooh, does she know that I'm wanting her so
Well, there's one thing I know, I can never let her go
Talkin' 'bout hot love, you're making me crazy
Hot love, you're making me bad
Hot love, you're making me crazy
Think I'll go mad
So cool, no fool, she's headin' for me
Can't run, can't hide, she's in everything I see
Ooh, what will I say, should I pass, should I play
But my feet turn to clay 'cause she's blowin' me away
Think I'll go mad (think I'll go mad)
Talkin' 'bout my hot love
Think I'll go mad, ooh
Talkin' 'bout my hot love, ooh
Think I'll go mad, yeah

You saw me comin', you had my number
But you don't want me, could you be dumber
Your eyes are flashin', your lips are willing
But I'm a patsy for the killing
You're so beautiful, so unforgettable
You think that I'd do most anything
Love is for dreamers, love is for believers
Love is for losers, love
Is for suckers
Love is for suckers, love is for suckers
Listen, I'm not some poor fool, won't jump through your hoop
Ain't gonna crawl, girl, to that I won't stoop
So if you want me, you'll have to get me
And if you're willing I'll be ready
To me that just don't mean anything
Listen, well, well, well, if it isn't little miss perfect
And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?
You wanna get back together? You do, huh?
Well, listen honey, I'm just not interested
You'll what? You will? With your heels on?
Oh no, come on, babe, let's go
Here I go again
You know that I'll do most anything
Listen, love is for suckers, love is for suckers
Sucker fight me, sucker fight you (love is for suckers)
Always be suckers and do most anything
I wanna be a sucker (love is for suckers)
I'm a sucker, you're a sucker
He's a sucker, she's a sucker (love is for suckers)
Would you like to be a sucker, to be sucker?
Love is for suckers, yeah, yeah
Sucker

Ow, alright
Hey girl, across the room
Say I'm in love, babe, it's much too soon
But you know I'd give you everything that I have
Girl, do you know what you're doin' to me?
I'm gettin' burned in the first degree
I want your love, never needed somethin' so bad
Ooh, I need your love, oh, I want your love
All I got to have is your love
Ooh, can't get enough, oh, you're so damn tough
All I ever want, ever need is you
I'm so hot for you
Baby love me through and through
Make you love me like I do
Hard night, just watchin' you
Can't take the way that you do what you do
I got to have you, girl, you know you're driving me mad
Do you wanna play, yeah, you know what to say
Come on, girl, I'm ready, come on, girl, I'm ready
Tell me I can stay, yeah, don't you be that way
Come on, girl, now how can you be so cruel
You got me comin' right on cue
I'm so hot for you, yeah
I'm so hot for you, I want your love
I'm so hot for you, can't get enough

Tonight
Are you ready for a hard time, are you ready for the ball to top 'em all
Are you ready for the long ride, are you ready for the rise before a fall
Are you ready for the big game, are you ready for the coup de tat, et al
Are you ready for the long train, are you ready for the final curtain call
Well, we're gonna kill 'em, gonna stomp 'em tonight
Yeah, we're gonna thrill 'em, gonna do 'em up right
Oh, we're gonna take 'em, gonna give 'em a fright
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, we're gonna lose control
Tonight, tonight, we're gonna have you all
Tonight, tonight, you're gonna beg for more
Tonight, tonight
Did you come to see the bad boys, did you come to watch us shake, rattle and roll
Did you come to hear us make noise, did you come to see us put it in the hole
Do you know that it's the right time, do you know that it's the time to lose your mind
Do you know that it's not a crime if you're bending all the rules that you can find
Well, we're gonna break 'em, gonna make 'em tonight
Yeah, we're gonna push 'em, gonna go for the light
Oh, we're gonna stroke 'em, gonna do it all night
Did you come to see the bad boys

Wooh
Always livin' on the outside, never had no place to hide
Feelin' so alone
I got this thing dead to rights, ain't givin' in without a fight
How the years have flown
Me and the boys we never lost control
It's one for all, yeah, we take care of our own
Me and the boys just wanna rock, there's some things you never stop
We got it and we're never lettin' go, just me and the boys
Me and the boys
We make a big noise, we gotta roll
We don't got a choice, it's in our soul
Oh, me and the boys
With our backs against the wall, no way we're gonna fall
We won't go away
Another place, another show, another face, another no
I got somethin' to say
Me and the boys we know our destiny, just how it is and how it's gonna be
Me and the boys take what we need, get in our way, we'll make you bleed
To the victor go the spoil in our creed, just me and the boys
Me and the boys we never lost control, it's one for all, we take care of our own

Wow, alright
I'm not bad, I'm damn good
But I'll admit I don't do all I should
I don't kill, I don't steal
Well, maybe only when I need a meal
All I'm saying's true but there's one thing that I do
And I just can't explain it, there's no way to restrain it
If I quit the rest I still couldn't pass the test
Cause I could not give up this one last thing
I got one bad habit (one bad habit)
I like to rock 'n' roll
I'm not mean, I'm not rude
But just don't make me lose my patience, dude
I don't curse, well just a bit
Somehow "gee whiz" and "golly" don't make it
Still they say I'm bad from the preachers to my dad
Cause I can't give up this feelin', it's just so damn appealin'
If they have their way I won't last another day
No matter how I try I can't stop this thing
I like to rock 'n' roll!
And if they find one day that it eats your mind away
That won't change the way I'm feelin', don't need that kind of healin'
There's nothin' else I crave so I'd trade the life I'd save
For my rock 'n' roll, now come on and sing
Rock 'n' roll (one bad habit)
I gotta rock, I gotta rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll (one bad habit)
Ooh rock my soul, yeah (one bad habit)
Ooh na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na yeah (one bad habit)
I gotta rock, gotta do rock, gotta do rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll

Whoa, yeah
This is the night I waited for
Countin' the days, I couldn't take one more
I broke my back, you know I strained my brain, oh yeah
And now the more I give the less I seem to gain, oh no
Now I'm on my time, I do what I wanna do
It's my time to shine, this is it, I'm breakin' through, oh
I want this night to last forever, oh yeah
I want this night to last forever
Listen to me now
Out on the street the night fills my brain
So many girls to meet, they'll never be the same, ha
My radio's playin' my favorite tune, oh yeah
This is the life, nothin' I'd rather do, no no
I feel so alive, leave my troubles far behind
Gonna rock tonight, takin' every chance I find, no
Let's go
All 'round, 'round the town, up and down, hear the sound
All 'round, 'round the town, up and down, whoa
All 'round, 'round the town, hear the sound, whoa
Come on, let's stroll
I got to have it
I want this night to last forever, I need it, woman, let's do it baby
I want this night to last forever, come on, boys, let's go

When I think of all the years and all the things I never say
How you fought back all your tears and you've never tried to walk away
Well I've been all 'round the world and I've seen all kinds of girls
And there's one thing that I know for sure
That there's no one else like you who loves me the way you do
For what's ailin' me you got the cure
Oh babe, listen to me, please
You are all that I need
All I want is you
All I wanna do
If you turned away from me sayin' this is what you have to do
If you said that we can't be, girl I'd always be in love with you
And if I live a thousand times
I'd be guilty of the crime of eternal love and dedication
And if I only get one chance to know the meaning of romance
Well then I'm happy with my education
Baby, baby, baby, listen to me, please
Baby, baby, won't you listen to me, please
You are, you are all that I need
All I want is you, all I need is you
Ooh yeah, yeah, all that I want, all I need is you

Yeah right
We got you where we want you and we're never lettin' go
Yeah right, yeah right
We've trapped you in our web now, aren't you old enough to know
So stomp your hands and clap your feet, do a dance, hook into the beat
Yeah right, yeah right, we got you now
We've pulled you into our world and you'll never get away
You might as well give in' cause we're big and mean and here to stay
So jump and shout, shake and cry, wave your fist, rock until you die
So stomp your hands and stomp those feet
Do a dance, hook into the beat

Oh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again, again and again, and again
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright
Neon Knights!
All right!

In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undone
Oh they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Ooh they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea, oh
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door
Oh they say that it's over, yeah
Yes they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
Poor lost children of the sea, yeah
LOOK OUT! The sky is falling down!
LOOK OUT! The world is spinning round and round and round!
LOOK OUT! The sun is going black, black
LOOK OUT! It's never never never coming back, LOOK OUT!

There's a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the wind won't blow
And they only speak in whispers of her name
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness
It eats right from her hand
With a crying shout she'll search you out
And freeze you where you stand
Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil in my mind
She's queen of the night
All right!
In a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the rain won't fall
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed, yeah
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness
She can't face the light
With an awful shout, she'll find you out
And have you for the night
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
So if you ever get to Witches' Valley
Don't dream or close your eyes
And never trust your shadow in the dark
'Cause there's a lady I know who takes your vision
And turns it all around
The things you see are what to be, lost and never found
She's the queen of sin
Look out, she'll pull you in!
Lady wonder!

Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's Heaven and Hell, oh well
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
the sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell, fool, fool!
Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on....
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!

Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real
Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Don't you know that I might be
Your wishing well
Look in the water, tell me what do you see
Reflections of the love you give to me
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
So let me fill myself with tears you cry, why?
Time is a never ending journey
Love is a never ending smile
Give me a sign to build a dream on
Dream on...
Yeah, Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
So let me fill myself with tears you cry
Someday, some way, you'll feel the things I say
Dream for a while
Of the things that make you smile
'Cause you know
Don't you know
Oh, you know
That I'm your wishing well
I wish you well
I'm your wishing well

Gather the wind
Though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun and it tears away
And it breaks you as you run, you run, you run
Behind the smile there's danger and a promise to be told
You'll never get old
Life's fantasy, to be locked away
And still to think you're free, you're free, we're free
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes
Die young, die young
Can't you see the writing in the air
Die young, gonna die young
Someone stopped the fair
Die young, young
Die young, die young, young
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!

Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floor
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more
She's got the look of freedom, and it makes you think she's wild
But I can see right through it all, it's the way to have a child
Oh, walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Walk away, walk on
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all
Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls
I've never been lonely, and I can't imagine why
Maybe she could be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die
Can't see her fire
But I can feel her heat, all right!
It's rising higher
I'm walking the wire
Walk on by!
Oh! Walk away!
Oh, walk on by, walk away!
Walk on!
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher
But don't be fooled! Just turn your head and walk away!

It's a long way to nowhere
And I'm leaving very soon
On the way we pass so close
To the back side of the moon
Hey join the traveler if you got nowhere to go
Hang your head and take my hand
It's the only road I know
Oh! Lonely is the word, yeah yeah yeah!
I've been higher than stardust
I've been seen upon the sun
I used to count in millions then
But now I only count in one
Come on, join the traveler
If you got nowhere to go
Yeah, Lonely is the word
Got to be the saddest song I ever heard
Yeah, Lonely is the name
Maybe life's a losing game

A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold, yeah
Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know
So let it all go!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!
Nighttime sorrow, taken like a pain
Black will not become a white, it's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!
If it feels right
Turn off the light!

Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin' you do will be new, 'cause I'm through
Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
Some can't accept but I crept inside you
So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
'Cause it's Voodoo, oh!
Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till your mine and you learn
So if a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes
'Cause he's Voodoo!
Voodoo!
Bring me your children, they'll burn!
Never look back, never turn!
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo!!

If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah
Fade away, fade away
Vanish into small
Break the crystal ball 
Oh
It's the sign
Feels like the time!
On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo doesn't answer
When it hears a certain sound
Then the beast is free to wander
But never is seen around
And it's the Sign of the Southern Cross
It's the Sign of the Southern Cross
All right
Sail away
To the sign
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten song
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Give a life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of sighs
Break the crystal ball
I can't accept it anymore
On a real world, west of wonder
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
They will make us strong!
Don't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away!
Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The Sign of the Southern Cross, yeah

Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away
If you listen to fools...
The Mob Rules
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, oh
It's over, it's done
The end is begun
Oh, They're breaking away
Break the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back around
You're all fools!
The Mob Rules!

Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah
We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air
In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars,
the endless search for where you are
(sail on, sail on)
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!
Don't sail away on a crimson tide!
Don't leave your heart on the other side!
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire with a special name
Don't ever fall in love!
Don't give your heart away!
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!

Slipping away, just a heartbeat from disaster
Nothing could make me stay, close your eyes and I'll be gone
Turn the page, yeah, time to start another story
Slipping away, slipping away, time to move along
No reason to stay
oh, when I'm slipping away
Take a look at yourself, you've been running in a circle
Round and round you go, you're a start without an end
Start a new life, yeah, from the city of the gypsies
Running away, slipping away, right behind the plow
Slipping away
Nobody to pay
look out, 'cause I'm slipping away
Rockin' the glass, I won't leave you my reflection
A future without a past, no more road to take me back
Come if you will, just don't question my direction
Running away, slipping away, we can find the sun
got nobody to pay
and you're slippin' away
No more running in a circle
it's time to move along
round, round, round we go
a start without an end
so I'm slipping away

I think about closing the door
And lately I think of it more
I'm living well out of my time
I feel like i'm losing my mind
I should be at the table round
A servant of the crown
The keeper of the sign
To sparkle and to shine
Never, no never again!
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can
Never, this is the end
You know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man
Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain
Save me, take me away
You know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!
I've got to be strong
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
Think you're safe, but you're wrong!
We are falling off the edge of the world!
Look out! there's danger! no where to run!
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done
Over, it's over at last
There's a message inside as we build a new life from the past
We're falling off the edge of the world!
Yes, the edge of the world!
It's the end of the world!

Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn
and sometimes I'm warm as fire
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain
and it goes over, and over, and over again, yeah
Too many flames, with too much to burn
and life's only made of paper
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain
but it goes over, and over, and over, and over again
Yeah, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone
and for their dreams that will all be ashes
and it goes over, and over, and over, and over againNow the time has come for me to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help
With swords in the night
Oh the last part of the game
Decision of death and life
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight
The final battle cry
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying for all
Children of death
I have a dream the things you've to hide for
Deliver our kingdom and our Reich
Don't fall in panic just give me the thing
That I need or I kill
Don't run away for what have I done
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And you'll leave us behind
And ruins remind of your time
Now come back
Run, run, run
Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Creature is following no place to escape
My last steps will find the right way
Where's the future the call of the blind
Cause there is none to find
Watch the sky you see no light
My weapons burst with fear
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die
For all Children of death
Run Run for the whole world
It's time you cannot wait
Lost Lost in a dark world
You feel the strange but cannot see
Too many battles we carry along from the war
And too many frightens we feel from his law
For so many victories we're praising so strong
For so many blood we've lost
Run, run

Extermination thunder the strange one is back again
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us out forever
Fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die
I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
I find taste on lampskin everything's allright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Now it feel the curse of the child
Dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it again
Fear our returning visions to madness we'll fall
if we can't kill the beast forever we must die now
One has blown his life away
Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die
By a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
little Billy you must find your way
Believe in you we ask for but where
we can never find
there must be a sign for the
Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse
Come to it's world following the sign
Give us the help we're waiting for your sign

Years ago I came back
this has been my hardest attack
A burning fire's in my brain
I could feel the deadly flame
Tales of the magic in my head
to a dark dream I fall in my mind
I hold the key of fortune
To feel the strange thing's in my mind
the stone of Ambar I must find
I'll take the chance that day
Halloween - The wizards crown I'll take on
Halloween
Halloween - But there is no return on Halloween
I'm the servant of the Blind to cross the
realms of death
the gate is open wide you cannot close
His dungeons deep no place to hide
The times have changed he has to fight
In magic spell I fall
Illusions falling in my mind
But where's the key I cannot find
the ritual has begun
The battle has begun
the warlocks time has come
I pay the price I've to pay
Why haven't see the signs
I'm loosing now my life
but cannot die forever life

There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creature will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
Run for the Night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and blooddlust their weapons and madness
you see their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
who the mightiest of all will now
You see them running in the shadows of the night
It is not what it used to be
they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you them running with the wind they
run for the night [3x]

He was born in the past time
To take all our pain
The kingdom of heaven's near
The children of this time
Must die for his arrive
To let all the legends be true
The prophecy said they'll call king of the Jews
He is born now to take all our sins
Three kings were searching for this holy child
The journey begins, he has to die
Healing the cripples and taking our pain
He came for the sinner
But what we've said
Disciples are following
They are calling his words
Salt of the earth and light of the world
Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
Messiah - we are torturing you
When you lose the power of your words
Jump from the temple and angle will save
Show me that you are the son of our God
Now take my land with my power you get
Rulin' the world of tomorrow
Messiah liar our burning desire
He is the king without a crown
We'll set him to his throne
Give me 30 p of silver and I'll be your man
Higher liar the fallen Messiah
Let us see his agony
The things he done are blasphemy
Mob has lost their joy on toy
So let us kill him fast
Now drink my blood for the new testament
This is my body you eat
One of you twelve is the one who betrays
Better that he's never born
Judas you're the chosen one
The world has damned your name
Begin with a kiss
At a cross it will end
The kingdom of heaven we've passed
The sky will turn black and the curtain will fall
The father's crying for his son
The tortured Messiah is finding his way
The journey has come to the end
The twelve ones are preaching the words he'd left
They're changing the way of the world but die for
No

Can't believe the things I see
That happens in the state
By a mortal distance that I can't believe
Self destructive infernal
To save us from the breed
But I know that it is all a lie
Star wars begin now
His bombs come exploding
To bring back the death of the night
No mercy he's knowing
How strong he must show us
For the last film you all get a part
Be by my side
Or you've to die
Believe what I do is the right
Soon Armageddon
Last hours are running now
The final solution begins
The words of a madman
No children to tell them
For what they'll not see in the light
Choose by your voice
He kills and destroys
At the end you must die for the night
In earlier chess games
We're playing the part of a soldier
But now we are not qualified
To save our own life
The traps are all placed by command
They are ready to strike
We live and we'll die
By the lies to believe
Try to escape from this suicide dreams
Or past time will come back again
Hiroshima is a joke to that what will come
At the end of the game we all die
Die now
Battalions of fear
They search and they scream
For the American dreams
The way of R.R.
To show he is the star
Battalions
Star wars
With hands full of blood
He talks about peace
With snake poisoning tongue
He's praying
El Salvador and Vietnam
You soon fast forget
But you satisfy on Afghanistan
You've been the master
You kill with a laughter
Your screams of peace are wrong and loud
Cause so we are and here we are
We scream and shout!
Your laughing about all the fools
Scream and shout!
With power of evil they stand

No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
"All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone"
"Save me your speeches
I know (They blinded us all)
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore"
Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"(We're) lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone
Come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown"
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Immortal land lies down in agony
"How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be"
But even in silence I heard the words
"An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken"
Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
"I swear revenge"
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge
"Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But) freely you came and
You freely shall depart
(So) never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends"
"Oh I'm heir of the high lord!"
"You better don't trust him"
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said
Back to where it all began

Far, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain
It lies unknown
The land of mine
A hidden gate
To save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence
Words of wisdom
I've seen the end of all
Be aware the storm gets closer
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
That tomorrows bears insanity
Gone's the wisdom
Of a thousand years
A world in fire and chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far
Deep down it lies my secret vision
I better keep it safe
Shall I leave my friends alone
Hidden in my twilight hall
(I) know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames
Alone
How shall we leave the lost road
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Even though
The storm calmed down
The bitter end
Is just a matter of time
Shall we dare the dragon
Merciless he's poisoning our hearts
Our hearts

Light fails at dawn
The moon is gone
And deadly the night reigns
Deceit
Finally I've found myself
In these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?
Barren and lifeless the land lies
Lord of all Noldor
A star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord
The Fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
I stand alone
Noone's by my side
I'll dare you
Come out
You coward
Now it's me or you
He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries
Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned
The iron crowned
Is getting closer
Swings his hammer
Down on him
Like a thunderstorm
He's crushing
Down the Noldor's
Proudest king
Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain
The Elvenking's broken
He stumbles and falls
The most proud and most valiant
His spirit survives
Praise our king

I feel cold
Facing the darkness
The light's gone away
Deep in his castle he said
All land'll be mine
There's one thing for sure
The triumph of shadow is near
Deep in his castle they sang
We shall not rest
Until all will be thyne
All land is mine
You can be sure
Don't dare me
the mighty one screamed
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till I'm king
Valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
Rise of Fall
a dark tale ends
just wondering how
in the darkness
they found their way
to the right place
children of the sun
second kindred
we call their race
treat them kindly
born in the east
(are the) nightfearer
they moved westwards
towards the sunshine
(they are) morning breath like
short's their life
(like) dawn passes by
when the day comes
the field was lost
(and) hope had passed away
the sun went down
beyond the sea
dark was the hour
but day shall come again
Clean my wounds
wash away all fear
let courage be mine
noone hears me crying
no song no tale
which contains all the grief
(but)
renowned the deeds
and the victims of defeat
sit down on your chair
and look out for your kin
with my eyes you'll see
and with my ears you'll hear
you troubled my day
and you've questioned my strength
(but) don't mess
with the master of fate
I smashed down the light
and dared Valinor
revenge will be mine
Slowly marching on
still we're marching on

I've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom
I've tasted poison
When I drank the wine of fate
But the fear was in my heart
I realized too late
The house of spirits call
Song of the doom
High's the fee
Soon my spirit will return
Welcome dawn
Your light will take me home
I say farewell
To the Eldar

It cannot be seen but there's blood on the green
Only God knows I'm innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me like the Storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
They're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still instead
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son they're gone
The Sun shines bright and anger rises
Lorn and lonely torn apart
Don't you think it's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
Let's pray that heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror shall honour arise
So let's pray and blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me crying, crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name
That's what the minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord

Run
'Til you find the answer
Time out
For our poor Cassandra
She's fairly safe inside the fire
Inside the fire
Awakes desire
Cruelly admired
They'll torture her soul
And they'll torment her heart
But won't change her mind
Would you like to see me
How I'll cut off
Her head life's a game
A lesson to learn
Don't be shy just blame me
Well, there is no
Need to feel ashamed
Remember the oath
Wake up
It's time to cross the border
Is it true what they say
About the part you've played?
Enjoy your stay here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
Please understand
It's not in our hands
Barren the land
It's all dead and gone
And still the tyrant's face is red
So witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
It's the sweetest taste
King of terror just stop wining
Hold your breath it won't take long
Realize this is your judgement day
In between the killing carry on
There are no rules here
Try to understand
You're the artificial enemy
An illusion we all need
For our sake
We're not allowed to see beyond that's your skill
Will we ever learn the lesson "We can't fly with broken wings"
Break the chains
Time to change
I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part
It's been nice we now get to the climax
Your destination's unknown
Just get out of my way
Don't mind the blood here
(No more gods)

A wooden cup and a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free
It doesn't matter anymore that someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before the Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me, shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
"The king's in town
We need a crown"
I think we all know how it ends
"So we're not going take it longer"
So all I know is I don't care
Now we are aware
There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance I hear the voices say
"We get him home tonight and that's all you need to know"
I'm alone
So I can't stand it any longer
And don't want to see it all
Nazarene, your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you

The faithful crowd is gathered here
Soon they'll appear
The high and mighty show up the king
Is in doubts
"Apart from this beggar here
There's no one like you my dear
Tasting my lips
No one but you and him"
Round the fire everyone should sing
And praise the gracious queen
Round the fire everyone should dance
And we praise the handsome knight
Forever and ever we both will be one
The maiden, the fair and the young
Fell in love
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
There's a moment in life when all the years will pass by
And the eyes filled with tears we once shed
We recognize failures, the desperate cries
Of the ones who believed in our lies
Whenever I'll go you'll be with me
My first though and my last
Though we'll depart in bitterness
One day you'll understand
Carry on
Beloved maiden, mine
Or we have to pay the price
Yesterday's memories and melodies
Are gone with the wind, so sad
Snow-white her hands and golden her hair
But she's not the one
Out in the emptiness where everything's pale
There is no sign of you, I'm alone
How I wish you would be here, I'm alone
Telling me it's alright, come rest (your head)
Come rest your head
I'm alone and sadness reigns in my heart
As long as we live it won't go away
We are one but torn apart
Proudly it stands
Until the world's end
The victorious banner of love

I cannot say that I don't care cause I'm aware
Of everyone and everything they're everywhere
Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain, your brain
The cautious hare cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
(He constantly) knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on
Silent creature, filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease, a release
A vanished kingdom falls
It goes on, on and on and again
It goes on, round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head
Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
I will wait for an answer so far
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation, we're the chosen ones
We're the tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels
Well the time is right you shall be on my (side)
I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen
There is not the slightest doubt at all
Not at all
In lower airs we're ground down by their ignorance
Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer
Round and round it goes on and again oh
I can't get it out of my head
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no
The hopeful he sadly admits there's no hero
No place to hide there is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground
It's you who has said there's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within, it's in your mind

I'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful, cruel but wise beyond his age
My body fails
My soul will (rise)
The end of life's immortalized
Disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
(Beyond the door)
There's something more
It seems there's just one way
On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel
The icy claw in me
For a descent price I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty pawned for my desire
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
And through the hour glass
Everything's grey, everyone's pale
Nor colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold
Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive
Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night
From a distant time voices echo in the hall
"Come and join us, enter life and everything is gone now"
And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and
Its loss in the end
(Unlimited) power in my hands
("Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned")
The claw of the dragon ascends
Each step I take mMay it hurt may It ache
Leads me further away from the past
But as long as I breathe (and) each smile on my bleak face
I'm on my way to find back to the Peace of mind

Cut off the light, take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope is gone
What have I done?
Denied the father and the son
For a moment it seemed
There's space beyond the spheres
Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
(You've been sacrificed in fear)
Now there's one thing for sure
I'm not afraid anymore
Day after day we've been fixed in this bowl for so long
For ages we're captured in shells and crystallized walls
Predestined or punished? By Man or God?
I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
The age of false innocence
(Take it away from me)
(And) for a while astronomy has moved the Earth
And we've turned around the Sun
(Sanctum Officium)
Has made me believe
"We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it to hear you crying"
I've slaughtered truth and I've shattered my heart
Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel, so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree
(Take It away from me)
Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part so we bleed in the name of God
Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven there won't be release
(I cannot) I will not

It's warm and tender but very soon it will turn cold
Shadows stare down from the walls
Out of the mist it's coming closer now
It never rains -- it pours on me
So let the saints
Set up the courtyard, the unpleasant cage
The obvious point is I'm insane
Was I aware whom I has slain, I fear I was:
The faceless
The nameless
The bush set on fire
No one ever dared to speak
"Shame on me, I don't believe
The here and now Is all we're living for"
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Witness my last breath
I do not regret
A word I've said
The strong will survive
The weak must die
And out of the mist
It's coming closer now
Sinner and saints --
The grateful slaves
Nature's law instead of God in heaven
From far beyond
I can hear them sing
I hear angels sing
Songs of innocence
I hear the angel sing
Despite the facts are clear
It cannot be, what we can't see
I must admit, it sounds so sweet
Angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
Far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"
From far beyond I hear them sing
Well we all know there's no other side
It's good and evil
I know right between, there's no borderline
This is the punishment divine
Surrounded by night, I've been offered insight
There is none but the sin of pride
Am I wrong am I right? Am I losing my sight?
Abandoning the superior mind
(Right away)
Through the valleys grey
(I will be gone)
Through the shapeless land I walk alone
I'm left alone
Through the deepest void, a blackened paradise
I walk alone, I'm left alone

Turn your head and see the fields of flames
(Don't move along)
He carries along
(Cause things they will go wrong)
From a distant place
(The end is getting closer)
He's on his way
(Day by day)
He'll bring decay
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight
Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for the starlight we wait for the Moon
The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
we're getting nowhere
We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome
We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight
It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall
Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out
We don't regret it
So many men have failed but now he's (gone)
Go out and get it
The madman's head it shall be thine
That someone else dies hidden in (disguise)
Orion's hound shines bright
Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running, running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided
By the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach
Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra, you may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Find myself in darkest places
(Sister mine)
Find myself drifting away
(Death's a certain thing)
And the other world
The other world appears
Find myself she dies in vain
I cannot be freed, I'm falling down
As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you, my dear
And then there was silence
Just a voice from the other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade
Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of three you've chosen misery
Power and wisdom you deny
(Bad choice, bad choice)
War is the only answer when Love will conquer fear
So the judgement's been made
To the fairest the graceful says
Badly he fails
(Warning)
Fear the heat of passion, father king
(Don't let him in
Don't let her in)
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
(We can't get out
Once they are in)
She's like the sunrise
Outshines the Moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price
(In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat)
Jealousy
(I can clearly see the end now)
I can clearly see the end now
(The thread of life is spun)
The coin's been placed below my tongue
Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side so we can win
Be on out side
(Old moon's time) is soon to come
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man
Roar Roar Roar Roar
Troy (Troy Troy Troy)
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb
(Hallowed) Troy will fall round the walls
Faith is shattered, bodies fall
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out
I feel that something's (wrong)
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept out of sight
We live
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
(Roam in darkness)
(We will be lost if you truly believe)
Troy in darkness
(There's a cold emptiness in our hearts)
That they've gone away
(And) won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite the end is near
You better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The war it is over forevermore
No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied
Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die
(Will) my weary soul find release for a while
Holy light shines on
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
The crack of doom, Father
Your handsome son is heading home
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
(Out of mind)
(Can't get it)
(Still the wind blows, calm and silent)
(Carries news from a distant shore)
(Can't get it out of my head)
Sorrow and defeat

Stop be quite now
Out with the light and
Then up and down it goes
Fly
Out with the light
There at the door
The inspiration I've looked for
The spirit of the youth appears
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe
Make believe
But one day
It all will come to life
Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
Then away we'll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark
In the land of mine
The second one to right
And then straight on
Until morning light
No irritation
No, not the slightest doubt
We got once
Quick - we better hurry
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts
And imaginations
These things will lift you up
What is it like?
You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies
Or things to fear?
For fairies sake I'd say
You better come with me
So soon you'll see
Now up and down it goes
And round
Round and round and round
Praise
To my cleverness
They all follow me
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs
Fly in
Fly out
They'll leave it all behind
No one ever dares to speak...
Life is a map
And it is quite confusing
The lights are up
Now let the play begin
She flies, she flies
Into the light she flies
No words like "Just" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now, now, nowIt's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all
Stand up and shout
Let it out
You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again
You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire, go on, explode

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies
Life's a never-ending wheel, say
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah!
Oh what's becoming of me? No! No!
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy Diver, sole survivor
You're the one who's clean
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you, Holy Diver
Oh Holy Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Hmm hmm hmm

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white
Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail
You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy
Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin
So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right
So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Flying away in the clouds
You know you're losing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow
You can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle

Don't talk to strangers
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down
Hey, you, you know me
You can touch me I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see
Can you feel me?
I'm danger, I'm the stranger
And I, I'm darkness
I'm anger, I'm pain
I, I'm the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away, go
No, no, don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down yeah
Run, run, run, run away

Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all
Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel
And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found
Oh here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one never told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no
But here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
In the middle of the heart
Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right through your heart
And here it comes, here it comes again
Straight through the heart

If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there
She had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And in the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down
It said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away
He was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in mama's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said
You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible
Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and then I took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door
So I go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible
Go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible
I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
Disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me, you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I, we're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear
It calling you beware
Look out
There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark, whoa oh oh

Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
All right
And shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
And I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say, oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh Lord, just go the way you came again
Oh, shame on the night
So I know I'd better run
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh, shame on the night
Here I go, I've got to run
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Well, I lost my hold on the magic flame
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
[evil laughter fading]

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind can penetrate your mind
But sail on, sing your song, carry on
Cause we rock, we rock
We rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices, all giving choices
If we listen, they will say, oh we can find the way
But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
We rock, we rock
Sail on, sing your song, carry on
Ride out, stand and shout, carry on
See how we rock
We rock, that's rock

We're the ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness
That it needs, yeah
We're a laugh without tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming, home
We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never, come home
But the magic that we'll feel
Is worth the lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down
We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
Then quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line
Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies
Between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase
Is worth the pain
We're the last in line, oh
Yeah, we're off to the witch
We may never, never, never come home
Is worth a lifetime
You know we're the throw before the toss
But the only way to go is down
See how we shine
We're the last in
We're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're the laugh without tear
We're the smile without the mirror

You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
'Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn
You're breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, willing to learn

Alright
Dark touches, send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure
I hate the light
I speed at night
At night
Alright!
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've got some stairs to heaven
You may be right
I only know in my world
You've got some stairs to heaven you may be right
I speed at night yeah!
I speed at night night night night night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
I speed at night alright

Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But riders in the night
Can lift you out of sight when they call
That's all
My Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
Then someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
There's no day, no way
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come, steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch?
Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm the poor, I'm the sure
I'm the holy, I'm the pure
I can tell you tales
You just might not believe
One night, one night
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play for
One night touching pretty
But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light
One night
One night feeling pretty
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty in the city
One child went away
And one child stayed to play
Chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up
Where they fall, in the city

Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know, no, no
It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, they'll see you anyway
Evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, evil eyes
They'll follow forever
'Cause they're evil eyes
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes

Can you hear me?
Can you see there's a storm
On the edge of the sky?
Does it matter?
Well, it does to me
And I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder
There should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no-one sees
There is only the dark
Just imagine, will you try?
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine
Not what you want to see

Well, it's been a long hot road I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there, no, no
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light, all right
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out
You've been hungry all of your life, yeah
We speed across emotion
And then we lose our hold
We turn on wheels of passion
That we can't control
So eat your heart out
Run to the shadows and hide
All on fire then he dies, then he dies, then he dies

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine
Then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew
That the chains were on
My, my, my
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand
As it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me
And that's free but still
Your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still, your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
Oh my, the chains were on
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still, the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still, her chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on
The chains were on, the chains were on
Yeah, the chains were on
Seen them walking on the water
The chains were on
Seen them flying through the sky
My, the chains were on
Yes, the chains were on

Hey the old ones speak of winter the young ones praise the sun and time just slips away
Oh running into nowhere turning like a wheel and a year becomes a day
Whenever we dream that's when we fly so here is a dream for just you and I
We'll fin the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heart
Oh here we see the wizard staring through the glass and he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie and the things you've got to do yeah
Oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
But oh sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night oh look to the light
Well you fight to kill the dragon and bargain with the beast and sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow and never leave the ground and still you don't know why
Whenever you dream you're holding the key it opens the door to let you be free yeah
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heart
A shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack and he's looking right at you quick
Run along the rainbow before it turns to black attack
And oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
Oh sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart yeah bleeding in the night yeah yeah 
We'll find the sacred heart

She's a rumor in the night it's crazy you can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light it's crazy but you go anywhere
It was just a summer night maybe when a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away maybe to go where where where
She crouches the hunter ready to tell you another lie another lie
You could see the side of someday feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway you were wrong wrong wrong
She jumped at the moment a chance to tell you another lie another lie another lie
She jumps at the moment she crouches the hunter yeah
You look and you know she's telling you another lie another lie another lie
Why it's crazy when you feel you're getting stronger another lie
Why it's crazy all the lies are getting longer another lie
Who oh yeah another lie another lie

It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door
She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar
The devil of one another
Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody broke a heart
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Without a friend
But they got Rock 'N' Roll
On the night that they cried forever
it was blinding with snow
On the night that they screamed goodbye
They were lost in the dark
And they never returned
On Rock 'N' Roll Children

Oh run it's a better thing than we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you and it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind 'cause a tear that never dies can only make you blind
You've got to try 'cause the future's never never gonna die
It's a storm that's never ending it's a truth without a doubt yeah eh
Tonight we run we can hide in the dark 'till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you and it's screaming let me out
It's a storm that's never ending it's a truth without a doubt
Now love can be a whisper but pain will always shout to you
Like the beat of a heart like the beat of a heart whoa beat your heart

You never sing for pleasure you only make the sounds
You never feel the magic 'cause you think the world is round
And you never dance in moonlight you run but you never move
You don't believe in someday and the truth is what you prove
But it's alright well it's all right just another day
Too many chains around you you laugh but you never smile
You don't belong in heaven but you're here all the while
And it's alright well it's all right just another day another day another day
Another day to let you down another way that they have found
Yes another day another way another way another day
You never feel the magic 'cause you think the world is spinning round for you
But it's alright yes it's all right well it's alright just another day

Screaming out alone in the night just a time and place but it's real all right
We are diamonds that shine without fire we're climbing the stairs
Going down and never higher we're fallen angels 
Something came to me in a dream the crack of a gun and a bloody scream
The I could see the faces and why I was holding the gun and the world began to die
For fallen angels falling down fallen angels come gather round yey
It's a criminal world and we all get to play you're a criminal
Sins of the children never get washed away
We're fallen angels goin' down oh we are fallen angels gather round
We are diamonds that shine without fire we are climbing the stairs
Going down and never higher we're fallen angels fallen angels fallen angels
If something comes to you in a dream open your eyes and scream it out
Remember that the evil will rule it's waiting outside bringin' pain for you fallen angels

All's well at the midnight hour you're ready to fly
Don't think about the darkness or the rumbling in the sky
Somewhere on the morning road just waiting for you
Somethings that just could never be are calling up a spell so you can see yeah
Dream evil the dark that you find in the back of your mind dream evil dream evil
Don't go to the edge of rainbows don't close your eyes
Like things that can't be real the truth is really lies
Don't wish on a rising star you should open up the door 
Where things that just should never be are calling up a spell so you can see yeah
Dream evil the dark that you find can come out of your mind dream evil take you away

The night has a thousand eyes but he moves in only places where the eyes can never be
The night tells a thousand lies and when you wake up in the morning were you dreaming screaming
Tryin' to hide your burnin' heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman
Somebody start the game and the dark will just get louder as it shouts away the light
A shadow without a name but when he wakes up in the morning he just won't know was he a hero
Tryin to hide his burning heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman anybody can sunset superman
Tryin' to hide your broken heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman superman oh oh oh
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman oh oh oh
Anybody can anybody can sunset superman oh oh oh 

There's perfect harmony in the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness hunted by the lion and the lamb ah ah ah ah
We bring you fantasy we bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle or we will disappear never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away sailed away
We bring you beautiful we teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe or we will disappear never to return again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away they sailed away sailed away
And as we drift along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle and a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds and then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness just lost like them and part of all the pain that they feel yeah
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away leaving nothing nothing more to say all the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful and they'll always let you in
But doors are never open to the child without a trace of sin sail away

Two faces on fire no traces something has swallowed the night you know that nothing can make it all right yeah
Like candy emotion too much and sugar can turn to sand you scream but nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain or do we see just what we are we're naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children guns loaded take aim and blow all the dreams away too late for anything better to say hey
Are we just crazy with the pain or do we see just what we are we are 
Naked in the rain naked in the rain maked in the rain
Two faces no fire no traces fever has turned to snow hearts break to show you the way as you go oh
Are we just running from the pain or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children on fire emotion burns higher guns loaded blow all the dreams away
Naked in the rain naked in the rain frightened by the pain naked in the rain

Seems like heard this song at least a thousand times before 
He just wanted her but she wants more so build a wall keep it all to herself oh oh
Always never seemed to be too much reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains sad remains another victim of overlove overlove
He was just the devil in a thing disquise jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page close the cage on another victim of overlove
Overlove yeah overlove overlove overlove overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone and come the dawn you got another victim of overlove
Overlove overlove overlove love love love love overlove

Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back and everytime there's sunshine I'm blind yeah
I am everybody and everyone that I know is me everyone that I know won't see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer yeah
I'm another number and you know the numbers must agree but everytime the wind blows I can't fly why
We take away tomorrow and never see the end of today lock it up and send it away forever
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star 
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are I could have been a dreamer oh oh
Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back but maybe that was sunshine that I saw
I've heard about a rainbow I've heard it makes you crazy I think I'm goin' crazy crazy 'cause I see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer I could have been the one to fly
I always could have been a dreamer 'cause dreamers never die no
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer dreamer
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer

Give me shelter shelter I can face the day then I'll just fade away give me shelter give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly the fire starts to die you open up your eyes 
Faces in the window noises in the night
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window
We are evil and we are all divine creations of the mind we are pleasure
I see clearly who's behind the wall yes I can see us all
We're faces in the window noises in the night
Give me shelter shelter shelter give me shelter shelter shelter
Faces in the window noises in the night faces in the window hiding from the light
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window
When the fire starts to die and you open up your eyes there they are in the window faces in the window
We are evil and divine just creations of the mind and faces in the window faces in the window

Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move they're shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire burning through your brain turn to face the train oh oh
Hey it's magic said the mother to the child it's stronger than a smile let it go
When a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah when a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah
Just when you think it's pretend here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever maybe we'll still just never know oh oh
Stars move shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire magic shakin' all the earth when a woman cries
Oh oh stars move thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky when a woman cries
When a woman cries aah when a woman cries yeah yeah 
When a woman cries when a woman cries oh

Silence - we hunt for the queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between
Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play hey-hey
Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Silence - we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold
Oh to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more
More's been empty for years
Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you
Small gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon

Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do
The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spider
Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes
Now I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Don't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wild
Why do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hear
Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
A spider
Inside her

You've made it through another day
Driving past the backroads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you
Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun
We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in
Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
No pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel
Some friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my way
Scream at the crazy ones
Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you
Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again
Again, again, again...

I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night - black as heaven
So no-one saw the gun
Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back around
Clutching to monsters in shadows
I can disappear - gone
Better in the dark

If they take away your song
You can finally hear the voices
Of the ones that don't belong
In the face of the rising wind
We all sing Gloria
Is there flame without fire
Most unlikely
If you're there when the walls come down
We all sing - warrior
Is there sight without sound
But we got rock and roll
Rock and roll
Take me anywhere
Is there someone there
On the edge of the last goodbye
Ah the brave never die
Hey, send your heroes of to war
But whisper in their ear
Never cross the song police
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again
For the sake of the left behind
Soon forgotten by time
So unlikely
Cause we got rock and roll
Take you anywhere
Someone's always there
Bring me anywhere
Rock and roll me, ah

You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push
You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
Go on and push

He'd never tell her lies
And she believed in magic
But when the magic died
She could see that all along he's just been
Guilty - a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty - burn in fire
It's time to say goodbye
Don't tell another story
Another alibi
Now you see that all along he's just been
Guilty - you burn in fire
Guilty - the great pretender
You're guilty - just surrender cause you're guilty
Broken promise
But please forgive again
One more time for me
It's the very last time - you'll see
Guilty - liar, liar
You'll burn in fire
Guilty - just surrender, you're guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty
A liar, liar
Guilty - you'll burn in fire
Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire
Surrender - guilty
So guilty

Oh-oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness
Wakes the dead
Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder
And she's afraid
Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
I'll make you safe and warm
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is no more little girl
Don't see her anymore
They disappear
Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today I heard that she was dead
You can hear them only if you try
Goodbye

Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousine
Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio
But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall
Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no
Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall
Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine
And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah

Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the show
The same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son
I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old time
There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Will you need more?
Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh
Much too long, I've been a prisoner here
The hour has come to break out
Shackled and chained, almost goin' insane
It's better to live on the run
Set me free, set me free
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
I have to think for myself and then act
In conformity of my own thoughts
No one should tell what's wrong and what's right
Why don't you leave me alone?
Set me free
Give me wings to fly
Ride on!

Coming from the sewerage, creepin' through the pipes
Born from modern chemistry, a thing that is alive
Growing in this rotten crap at places no one wipes
Eating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thrive
The scientists got no way to fight
For they can't find any weak point to get rid of it right
You live your life and you don't know what's goin' on
You just can't stop a-thinking that the officials do you wrong
You're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's arm
And the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harm
Even thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the door
Frustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whore
You won't believe till you know that it's real
From the pain in your stomach and the horror you feel
You need a shit, so you head off for the loo
You're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do!
There's the reptile (reptile)
Just see his eyes
Reptile (reptile)
Can you see the beast arise?
Creeping up on you
There's nothing left that you can do
And there's the reptile (reptile)
Hidden till now
But now it's there; you don't know how
Just watch it grow
And there's no more human being left but you
You
Oh, yeah!

We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axis
Of our minds without love without hate
We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers, we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string
Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them, we might all fail
We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show
There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been
With new minds made so clean
They will be the saints
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Take care eternally
Puppets on a string

There are phantoms here on earth who take away our lives
They kill your kids and they rape your wives
They rip your flesh, tear your heart, take you down to hell
They don't give a damn on any kind of life
Phantoms bring evil, destruction, and death
Night after night, the same old game
They all look so harmless, but deep in their hearts
Satan is lurking, and he will break out
Always someone at your back
Only waiting to attack
Phantoms of death
The empire of deceivers is built upon your fear
You'll have to lose it, 'cause the end is near
Warheads, armies stand to strike; I know it isn't right
I wanna get out of here; I don't wanna die
Infernal destruction; in fire, you'll burn
Then you'll be helpless, but it's not too late
Stand up right now and you'll be the winner
Or Satan will get you, take you forever
Genocide everywhere
Where's the savior of this world?
Where is he, the promised savior? The one who'll save the earth
Perhaps he'll come to bury us, but then it'll be too late
Who are they? Who are the phantoms who will end our lives?
It's you and me, you and me; open up our eyes
We are all parasites of this world
We shall die

Full moon, standing in the streets
I know the time is near
Incarnate power roaring from the sky
Unrelenting forces blasting through the air
Roaring thunder, lift your hands and pray
Running through the empty streets
They're looking for the fight
Swords gleam in the light of moon
The gods prepare to strike
Metal invaders, ready to strike
A warning from hell, be careful tonight
All right!
Dark night overwhelming bright light
See the demons fly
Can't trust your senses; fear you'll have to die
Super mighty shadows casting amplitudes to ears
Sounds you've never heard that take you high
Time has come for them to rise
Invasion is their doom
Riding high on iron horses
In the light of moon
Metal invaders, the gods on their ride
Sworn to bring metal, mayhem tonight
Tonight!
Tonight...

You're runnin' around in the gamblin' hall
Every night, it's the same
You're lookin' for something new to play
To win and have fun is your aim
A pinball speaks to you
His metal voice is knockin' in your head
You can't resist; you'll have to play
You're just another victim caught in the trap
Gorgar will eat you
Gorgar—man, you'll never win—hey
Gorgar—but you keep on playin'—hey
Your blood is boilin'; your eyes grow wide
Advance—too late
Gamblin' fever has taken your mind
This fuckin' machine, oh, hate
You spend all your money
But you'll never win
You're always the loser
And the robot's voice keeps hammering
Wastin' money for fun every night
Livin' for today, no thoughts for tomorrow
Man, you are dead, don't you realize?
Wake up and live before it's too late
Too late!
Gorgar—but you keep on playin'
Tilt

Fight hard
Live fast
Play loud
Step out of the crowd
Iron
Rulin'
Steel bent
Forever, the faith will live on in our hearts
There's nothing else in all the world
That will bring it down
We will play our wildest step to all around
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood
Power
Burnin'
Brains out
United metallians ready to strike
White heat
Red hot
Mayhem
If you don't feel it, you won't understand
Heavy Metal is the law that keeps us all united free
A law that shatters earth and hell
Heavy Metal can't be beaten by any dynasty
We're all wizards fightin' with our spell

A lot of things occur each day
We've got to live with on our way
There's so much misery on the screen
With commercials in between
And the Russians won't be so late
Uncle Sam don't wanna wait
No matter if you're black or white
You never, ever had a right
And look up to the eternal skies
See warfare even there
What once has been a paradise
Now destruction and despair
In other worlds, the children die
Lacking food, ill from a fly
Oppressed by troops to tame their land
It's all the same again
If any man is free on earth
Then tormentors steal his birth
They slam gun butts in his face
And leave his woman choked in mace
So, stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise your voice, pass on the light
Unite! It's not too late
How many tears flow away
To become a sea of fears?
How many hearts are torn apart
Till another torment starts?
But before the world
Turns into a sun
All cruelty and violence
On earth will be dead and gone

You, you say, you have lost the way
Got no aim, just livin' for today
Look up to the sky above
And see the morning sun again
You got so much power inside
So cry it out my friend
I'm alive, I'm alive
There's no use in hangin' all around
You're a king, can't you see your crown
Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
You just need a friend
Together we will sing along
I'm alive

Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground
Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I want to do so much in my way"
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burning so hot in my head
We got
A little time to build up our lives
A little time to make up our minds
A little time to fill up our dreams
A little time, time

Insania, 204
We've thrown away our former Gods
Controlling our day
We have created better ones
So we control the way
We are the ones with the power
To hold down the enemy
Our Gods are perfection
And they are protecting our lives
We still need some more of them
To be safe from the other side
As long as we're stronger
Nothing will happen to us
Fire flash in the night
Just an evil dream
Holy war in the sky
Never
Insania, 2016
Error in store 103
We watch the sun at night
The pretty Gods we've built ourselves
Now terminate our lives
Silicone brain, powered voices
Are crying attack tonight
Our Gods are now fighting
In anger, burning our world
Doomsday has come
And there is no place to hide away
The future is over
And there is no turning back
Now reality
Twilight of the Gods
Insania's dead and gone
Another world was born
But the twilight soon will come

Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid it's breakin' twice
Thanks to you, my dear old friend
But you can't help, this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I won't have no sleep tonight
In my heart, in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong, young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
It's alright, we'll stay friends
Trustin' in my confidence
And let's say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight
With my heart, with my soul
Some guys cry, you've bought and sold
They've been strong, young and bold
And they say, play this song again

If you're out there all alone
And you don't know where to go to
Come and take a trip with me to Future World
And if you're running through your life
And you don't know what the sense is
Come and look how it could be, in Future World
We all live in happiness our life is full of joy
We say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side
We love our life and we know we will stay
'Cause we all live in Future World
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious
Come with me - Future World
You say you'd like to stay
But this is not your time
Go back, find your own way to Future World
Life can be for living
Just try and never give in
Tell everyone the way to Future World
One day you'll live in happiness
With a heart that's full of joy
You'll say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness will be at your side
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why
Scream it out
We all live in Future World
Come with me
Future World
Future World!

Masquerade, masquerade
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out well disguised
Heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat, they have no choice
Little ghosts are making lots of noise
But watch out (watch out)
Beware
Listen (listen)
And take care
In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's Hell or paradise
It's Halloween
Tonight
Someone's sitting in a field
Never giving yield
Sitting there with gleaming eyes
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie
Well, watch out (watch out)
Listen now, we are calling you
Listen tonight, we are calling you
And there is magic in the air
Magic in the air
On Halloween
Black is night, full of fright
You'll be missing day
What will be here very soon?
Changing your way
A knock at your door
Is it real or is it a dream?
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream on Halloween, on Halloween
Darkness, where am I now?
Is there anybody out there?
What has happened?
Am I in Heaven or is it Hell?
I can see a light come
It's coming nearer, it's shining
It's shines so bright
It's shining on me
I am the one
Doom's in my hands
Now, make your choice
Redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man
Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind
Deliverance and peace of mind
But watch out, watch out, beware
Listen, listen, take care
Yeah, it's Halloween

People are in big confusion
They don't like their constitutions
Every day, they draw conclusions
And they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective
Some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective
Well, your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care about what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free, let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind, follow the sign
Together we fly someday
Hey, we think so supersonic
And we make our bombs atomic
Or the better, quite neutronic
But the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays, the air's polluted
Ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed
To create a better time
Forever we fly
Together we fly
Forever we fly someday
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoooooaaaaaaa...

When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back
There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before
When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
The life I try to give is
All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone
Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
See his strong hands
But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
See the drunk man, try to ask him why
He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
There's a fight in his head he cannot win
Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin
You... you cannot hide
You... you cannot describe your feelings inside

Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
Everyone could see him fall
And be sure it's been his last hit
He's never been seen at all
Some dictator felt progressive
And lay down in the sun
But his people were aggressive
They killed him with a gun
Sometimes you're wrong
By some things you have done
You see fate is too strong
Nothing's won
No use for a fight
If you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size
Like a lie
It's the rise and fall
The prize for all
That ain't nice at all
Luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain
A little dragon could spit fire
But never so for something bad
He didn't know the knight's desire
To throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet
Their parents told them "Stop"
Then it all turned out peculiar
He couldn't get it up
And it's all in vain
When you're living with pain
Reap not goods you have grown
By your own
Feelings you like
Disappear overnight
You sip up every grin
Free to win
You nearly go insane
A spaceman flies the rocket
That takes him to the stars
Thinks his wife is in his pocket
But she's strolling 'round in bars
The king of Los Angeles
Bought himself a teddy bear
And the queen became shameless
She did it with a chair

Once they killed his monster
When he went into a trap
Now, he's making better ones
On a higher step
On a warm summer day
The doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now, his hips are aching, what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right
Time is right
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers
And they do it their own way
They mix some DNA
Some skin and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Helloween
They become great politicians
One night, he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought
Well, never mind
Took a syringe and blew out his life
They become a great possession
They become a great oppression
Time is right, time is right, time is right

Don't turn your head
Back to the wall
Don't close your eyes
And wait for your fall
If you believe that you know in this time
You've got anything to win
If you believe that you know
Then I say, "you'll lose all again"
In this time there's nothing to get for you
You cannot really do what you want
You're a child, a prisoner in your mind
You are a victim of this hopeless time
You better believe all you do has a sense
It's not for nothing
You better believe all the troubles you have
Will play you someday
Why don't you help yourself and do the best
Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
Why don't you stand up to say who you are
To show the people that paradise is not far
Oh, can't you see we got the right
To look into the future without no need to hide
No, we won't accept what you do
We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
To say we are here to see the light
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can
We are credulous idiots
And won't understand what they plan
We march with the times
It's what they expect and we do
Why don't you open your eyes
To undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
Go oppose with your fist
Fight for your rights

Too late to call for the priest
He is not here anymore
We look at the age of the beast
And we've seen its vast armies form, hear our call
Please, save us, please, save us
In permanent madness we live
No time for life and for love
To take is the rule, not to give
Insanity comes from below to take us all
We believe that the phenomena of nature
Are the expression of infinitive intelligence
We express our belief that all forms of life
Are manifestations of spirit
And thus, all men are children of God
Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
Waiting for his future and the final call
We stand on the edge of the world
Just one step more and we fall
Guide us and please take our hands
Without You were weak and alone, hear our call
Please, save us, please, save us now
Save us from the gods of thunder
Save us from the dogs of war
Save us from the creeping nightmares
Save us from the evils course
Save us from our own ignorance
Save us from the man in black
Save us from the desolation
Save us from the hate attack
Save us, oh, please
Save us, oh, please, save us
Save us now

Hours of lust, hours of tears
Passing by before my eyes
Today, tomorrow, yesterday, one life
Days of joy, day of sadness
Come and go to pass me by
A month, a year, one hundred years
They fly
One day I will be gone
To lead another life
And this world will stop
To turn around with me
Cause time marches
Time marches on without us all
Never stops, yes
Time marches
Time marches on and on and on
Flies eternally
Times of peace, times of fights
Constant movement is our life
Can't stop no more, not until we die
We long for more
Eternity and maybe there's another life
This one is short, no matter how you try
But never give up
All the hope to lead a good life
No, don't waste your given time
To make things worse
Please, please help me see
The best way to be
Make a change and we live eternally
No more wasted years
No more wasted tears
Life's too short to cry
Long enough to try

From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No-one asks us how we'd like to be
In school they teach us what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
At a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this
I want out
To live my life alone
Leave me be
To do things on my own
To live my life and to be free
People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
Cause I decide the way things gonna be
There's a million ways (million ways) to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool (million ways)
In the end of it, (in the end) none of us is right
Sometimes, we need to be alone (alone, alone, alone)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave me alone

Make the people hold each other's hands
And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind
So do as divined
Put on your armour, ragged after fights
Hold up your sword
You're leaving the line
Make yourself ready for the lords of the dark
They watch your way
So be cautious, quiet and hark
You hear them whispering in the crowns of the trees
You're whirling round, but your eyes don't agree
Will-o'-the-wisps misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse
Without taking their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us be
Kill that Satan who won't let us begin
You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from Demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat running down your neck
And the dwarves of falseness throw mud at your back
Guided by spells from the old seer's hand
You're suffering pain only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust, heat and sway
Throw the first key into the sea of hate
Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belonged into the sea of greed
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Throw the key or you may die
On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He's sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He's playing you on with delight
Man, who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven scars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be
Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key, throw the key
Throw the key
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming and earth swallowing him away
You've locked up the seven seas
And the seer of visions can now rest in peace
There ain't no more Demons and no more disease
And mankind live up, you're free again
Yes, the tyrant is dead
He is gone, overthrown
You have given our souls back to light
Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law
I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive
So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight
Oh, I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha!)
I can howl at the rain (Ow!)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains
Love me tonight

Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Oh!
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!
I shall return from out of the... (Fire!)

Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
Oh, I'm running free
I spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free
Get out of my way, hey
Right?
Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah!
Oh
I'm running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah, yeah!
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah
Running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) yeah
Ow, ow! Ow, ow!

I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
Torture me back at your lair

The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh
Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old
Oh, baby
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a "fiver", it's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?
Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well, Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'Cause you're making love all day
Aw, 'cause you're making
Ooh
Ooh yeah

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought
Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
Just come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
I'm a wrathchild
Ah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh... yeah!
Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah!

I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Flee before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy
I'm running from the Gendarmes
I'm never coming home
Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of
Running from the arms of the law
Running from the Gendarmes
It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that inside my mind
Well, I've got to say I've done it before
They're never gonna find me
I'm never going home

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began
I'm running away, nowhere to go
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know. Yeah
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah

Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ooh, look out!
You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me
I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oh yeah, I've done it again!
Yeah!
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you!
Aha ha ha ha!
Oh! Oh!

Listen to me, Lamia, listen to what I've got to say
I've got these feelings and they won't go away
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees
Oh, help me, Lamia, or I'm sure I'll die, oh, please
I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be
I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please
Oh, Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh

Thinking of an age old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Is it me, I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led
Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!
Forever now, I can't think why
Or is it me, I just don't know
When you see me walking up beside you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away!

She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form
It's been three long years since I've been gone
I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
I'll never know the reason why I had to go
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?
I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone
Oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?

Walk away, yeah!
Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
Sitting here, think it's gonna be a new day
Gonna get my song and I can't go wrong
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song
What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song
Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh hoo
Ooh yeah
I keep on drifting
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah
I'm gonna sing my song, yeah
And it won't take long
I want you to sing along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
'Cause I'm a drifter
Drifting on
Yeah!

Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around
So be prepared – don't run – stand your ground
They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders... Pillaging!
Invaders... Looting!
Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders... Fighting!
Invaders... Marauding!
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle-weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
Invaders... Raping!
Invaders... Plundering!

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the Damned
He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought, "Oblivion? Well, it beckons us all."
Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?
Oh-o-o-o-o-ooh
You're children of the Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight

We want information, information, information
Who are you?
The new number 2
Who is number 1?
You are number 6
I am not a number, I am a free man!
I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feet
Goin' all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going – out!
If you kill me, it's self-defense
But if I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid of when I call out your name
Run, fight to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don't
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me

Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty six
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah!
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
666 the one for you and me
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?
A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail
Dead men, gangland
Murder, gangland
Tell no tales

Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who wasted her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice
Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Numbing our desires
Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
"Is this the end?" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm
Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun

I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God why has He let me go?
As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare

"O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride"
Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips
The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn
Go
Bind all of us together
Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
Still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you

As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God, my father, I fly"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave
Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
Fly

Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
If you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
13, the beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise
Terror, death, destruction
Pour from the eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands
They died, with their boots on
Yes, they died
They died, they died, with their boots on
We died, we died, we died, we died, we died

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

What ho said the t'ing with the three bonce, don't meddle with things you don't understand
Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me
Oh I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane
I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do
Oh they drain my strength away
Oh they're asking me to stay
Nightmares. Spirits calling me
Nightmares. They won't leave me be
All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool
Now I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear
Nightmares. Coming all the time
Nightmares. Will give me peace of mind
Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too
Oh we'll drown together
It will be forever
Nightmares. Forever calling me
Nightmares. Now we rest in peace

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Discovery of man
And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat
They searched all across the land

Well, you killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct, Animal supreme
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last – nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade and break you both
In two – break you both in two
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on
And it's rolling still

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it that you would die
In the desert the planet Dune
Without a still suit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the 'mice'
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'
He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars
The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down
You'll see he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men
And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
He'll make a stand
Against evil the fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout "Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers."
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun
Midnight
It's all night

As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men

He threw down a glove, you made the mistake
Of picking it up, now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance
Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Fight for your life
Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow
The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile, the reaper looks on
Oh, oh, fought for the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought for the pleasure
Fought to the death

Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole, and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Tables start to burn
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
But still, we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name!
Back in the village
I'm back in the village

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Slave to the Power of Death

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Slave to the Power of Death

If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?
Time is always on my side
Can I tempt you, come with me
Be Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go, would you be scared?
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be honestly
Just let yourself go
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong
Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally... let yourself go!
Caught now in two minds!

From the coast of gold across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
Out in the night somebody's crying
Of madness

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying, I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare
Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided
Oh oh
My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take
Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on
Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone and men again
They came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone
Trapped inside this prison

When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?
When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?
'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like I've been here before
Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before?
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged
'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

"My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee"
Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander
At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Became a legend amongst mortal men
King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia
Became a god amongst mortal men
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
He died of fever in Babylon

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die
One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep
Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end?
In Heaven or in Hell?
Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams
There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again

Can I play with madness?
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
There's no vision there at all
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)
He said:
He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see
I screamed aloud to the old man
I said "Don't lie, don't say you don't know"
I say "You'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next"
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said "You wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
"Listen to me," said the prophet

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn
You know, you know
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do

Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds
Seventh son of a seventh son
Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil, which path will he take?
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late
Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman, the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me?
Is it so hard to understand?
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends
Suffering and pain, impending disaster
Souls crying, the Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits
I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me
Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?
Purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, Hell awaits
I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late

Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?
I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
...and be reborn again?

The demon in your mind will tear you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
My fate is sealed
If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath
Your time will come
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
Brothers and their fathers joining hands to make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel
I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son

Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home
Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your soul to this brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world
Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt
There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted, which are you?
Diablo, come again
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus snap in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will, iron fist
How could it have come to this?

Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now? Is it really happening?
Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination?
I just can't take no more
The dream is true, the dream is true
Think I've heard your voice before
Think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
Coming to the realisation
That I can't see for sure
I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
To save me from myself
I get up, put on the light
Dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep myself from drifting
Saving me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost, a nightmare I retrace
Lost, a hell that I revisit
Lost, another time and place
Lost, a parallel existence

Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a Devil to get ready and take over your mind
You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the only one
I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
Beaten, fallen Angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no-one knows
Nomad, where you go to no-one tells
Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No-one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told
No-one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no-one's seen you kill
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius
Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
No man ever understood your genius
Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no-one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Withered hands, withered bodies
Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty
The punishment is death for all who live
Dreams of desolation
Come the Demons of creation
The killing fields, the grinding wheels
Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you
Before you know the crime, it's all too late

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
The thin line between love and hate

I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go
And I just feel I can be anything
That all I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I wanna be
Make my wildest dreams come true
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
Out on the road again
When I remember back to how that
Things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell
When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be
I'm gonna break away
I'm out on my own
Breaking away

When I was wandering in the desert
I was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives
Like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
To wash the tears
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away

There's a darkened sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me
Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me
A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No-one can stop me now
Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait till then
No more lies!
They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
But there's more things I have to do
Don't tell me that this is the end

I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocents, evil took place
The angels were burning inside
Centuries later I wonder why
What secret that they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion still burning inside
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free
The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan his weapon is lust
Living this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of life
The perfect would willingly have died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of god they had claimed
Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars and to die and be free

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me
And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures – they were undead – all of them
They had ascended from hell
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Have a drink and say a prayer for it
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead

Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights
To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead

Bleeding you dry from the start
The sum of my parts
To give it away
New life in a day
Some new Frankenstein
Damned for all time
Cursed by the angel who fell
Who saves me from Hell?
And who is my god?
And where is my soul?
Too tired to jump, too young to run
Never-ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man
I want to end my life now
But I don't know how
Recycled again, a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The Devil has planned

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years
Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon
Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
But the war, no chance to live again
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go
Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale
Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go
Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat
See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale

Everybody's waiting for something to happen
Everybody's waiting for something to see
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters
Everyone's waiting for news on TV
Winding lives at the end of the spiral
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill
Everyone's looking but no-one is listening
Everybody wants to be in at the kill
I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end of time
Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing
Everyone's looking for the reason why
Everyone's hoping for life ever after
Everyone's looking at death from the sky
Everyone's nightmares are going to happen
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes
Everyone's praying but no-one's believing
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies
I see the signs of the end
So I watch and I wait and I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all
And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war
So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low
You can't protect yourselves, even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals, they laugh right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace
Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore
And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
But the memory still remains
All the past years, not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun
Spare your life and you choose the destruction of time over yourself
Yeah!

Where would you be without music
You wouldn't be nowhere it all
You wouldn't be here to invest,oh
If you weren't in heaven no more
One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Well,thank fully we've got the boys
The melody lies fascinated
The rhythm is something divine
Send out a trend of impatience
To see you all movin' so fine
Got to find it soon

Man eatin' momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys
She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
You can take her if you want her you can
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline

Got no silver for my pocket
got no pillow for my head
and the winter it gets stronger
got to ease my aching head
In the morning when I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'm dying
Or I'll got out of my mind
I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my sense reeling
Knowing winter's come to town

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep
She was a cheater
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you
You are a cheater
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go...
This could be or last show
Changing dreams changing schemes... NEVER
We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should I give sorrow, or turn 'round and sneer
I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride
Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall
I can't go on
I, I, I, I...

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open minded,but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said i was there
Lead to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led
Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day,
Is this the way that you get your fun slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun,
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob.
You make me sick getting paid for murder,
But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her.
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds 'cause you won't go to hell.
Take your medal, wear it now with pride.
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside.

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Second to none

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight
Capped everywhere
I've held my licence
It came with birth,
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions
To the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Look around
They're moving in
Hold your ground
When they begin
We can do it
We can do it and if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United we stand one and all
So keep it up
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
[fade]

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
[repeat and fade]

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight
I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance
I'm gonna take
Gonna get out trouble and strife
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise
No I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties
No compromise
Wanna taste what it's like to be free
I'm gonna gather my things
Go through the door
Every night I'll live on my own
I'd like to be there
And I'm gonna be there
I got a will of my own
I go as I please
Fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When I need it
Then I'll ask for advice
[fade]

From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
At every wind what a stake we're in
Is pain better than the grave
When we talk without amend
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike
Kiss of Judas, spider like
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
But you don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm elected protective, detective, Electric Eye!

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light.
Glowin' god of Mars
Body burning bright.
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind.
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power.
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud.
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds.

I've been trying
There's no denying.
It's sending me
Out of my mind.
I've seen reason
Change to treason.
It's losing its sense
Of all kind.
How much longer will it take
For the world to see.
We should learn to live
And simply let it be.
Bloodstone, bloodstone.
In the night time
Wake in fright.
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played.
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made
Bloodstone.
I can't take it.
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that bloodstone.

I move away it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like I thought it would.
Help me, I'm beggin' you please.
You've got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life.
Leave me be.
Take these chains off
Take 'em off of my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave
I tried to run but I'm tied to you like a slave.
It's my fault for loving you so
You were so precious, how could I know.
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me.
I don't owe you anything
Why don't you get out of my life.
Through it all the memories cling
And I can't sleep at night.

I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go.
I've heard the rumours and it seems they're comin' true
do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new.
Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through.
How I suffer for your love.
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried.
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life.
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
You don't know what I like.
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messin' 'round, practice what you preach.
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive

Hey listen don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right.
They're playing at a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear.
Always takin' baby out that's o.k.
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me.
Told you one you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face.
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place.
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace.
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you 'round in the torture before the dread.
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter.
As the sweat is runnin' down your neck
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up.
Oh your heart is pumpin' gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load.
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line.
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake.
I don't talk about it but that's alright
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight.
If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate.

One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud.
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'.
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best.
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.

I'd spend my days alone
I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there.
Like I was in a cell
A captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair.
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control.
Down on the streets below
Bright city lights would glow.
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze
Still counting empty days.
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break the spell.
Fever.  You set my soul on fire.
Fever.  You fill me with desire.
Fever.  You always get it right.
Fever.  All day and all night.
Then one night as I walked
I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar.
Oh how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this.
So destiny has brought us
Oh so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream
At last I'll be with you forever.
And all at once it feels so right.

Hypnotize me
Mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip.
Light my fire
With cold desire
Losing all my grip.
Eat my diamonds
Drinkin' all my gin
Feast your eyes on
A whole lotta sin.
On no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no got your claws stuck in my
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child.
Took my dreams
And now it seems you're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre.
Stop pretendin'
Got me growin' old
Your tormentin's
Fit to snap my soul.
You took my heart
And left it blown to smithereens.
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh
And drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed.
Goin' under
Hear the thunder
Death defying grace.
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face.
Vivious talkin'
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised, so abused
I'm a human sacrifice.

When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you.
You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You Pulled me back to earth
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future
Will you ever set me free
Take me into your arms again
In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain.

Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in
Never stops the Way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
You'll find there's life with victory
With victory on high
Freewheel burning [x8]

Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode - Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down
Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
All your life
Tough as steel
Stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
All your life...

Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figure's primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemned to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives
Now facing one another
The stand-off eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown

When you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise
That's when I crawl
Gliding on mist
Hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss
Evils abound
In the dead of night
Love bites
Into your room
Where in deep sleep
There you lie still
To you I creep
Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend
You smile as I sip
Now you are mine
In my control
One taste of your life
And I own your soul
Softly you stir
Gently you moan
Lust's in the air
Wake as I groan
Love bites you
Invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you
Delights you
It drains you to white
You knew at first sight
You'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite
There'd be no turning back
So come in my arms
I strike any hour
I will return
To trap and devour
Love bites...

Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
And eat me alive
Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver as
You give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as
The rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive

You can look to the left and look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights-flashing colors
Sleepless nights...
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks who are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
And slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day burning hell fire
You're blown away...
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
And the man with the power
No! No! ...

In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days (yeah)
That's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
And there's nowhere to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Then I will wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
And there's no place to go
Oh no!
You won't be there tomorrow
Say it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
And there's no place to go...

I know you like it hot
Love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside ya till the power splits your head
We're gonna rock ya till your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with an iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
So come on let's tell the world

Why do I have to wait so long
Before you come into my life again
Seems as though forever until
I can be here by your side till then
I think you feel the same way too
You know you make my dreams come true
If you'll just turn on your light
Let me see it shining through the night
When I'm far away from here
I'll hold all the memories so clear
If I only have the choice
I would stay so let me hear your voice

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one

When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimensions
It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling
Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings
Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision
An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
Your gonna get richer, I gotta get wild
Any time you want to
Any way you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Live that fantasy
I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane late at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light
You know where we're going
I know where we are
Set the rear view mirror for the backseat of the car
In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you
When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotised
Never seen nothin' like it no,
You won't believe your eyes
Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean
Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling to the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar
Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound
Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night
Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on
Do you love it loud

Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more the pain you'll feel
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice
Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
so expect the worst
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry, is victory, is victory

As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting
Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice
Not begging you
I'm telling you
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night
They're closing in
They'll never win
You won't make me,
As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down
just I'll face you under
Hands of justice
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear

The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me
And carved out of stone
I've broken hearts
Made people sing
I've drove a million miles
I've done everything
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
And no one can take that away
Bring on the night
That's when I live
I come alive inside
Give all I can give
I live each day
Like it's my last
I live for rock and roll
I never look back
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me

I've broken hearts

I've drove a million miles
I've done everything
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say

I live for rock and roll
I never look back
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

You get me up, then we both get down
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds
I'm all tied up on your bed
I'd rather be inside your head
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back
Then you ease off with your attack
You're the best I've had if you please
You never stop, you great big tease
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show

It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all
corners of the land
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of
hand
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Impossible to stop
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in
awe
At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for
And millions roared, and millions cheered
This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore en-captured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Pain! Pain!
Killer! Killer!
Can't stop the Painkiller!
Pain!

Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road
Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol
Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground
Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you
Crome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All Guns, All Guns Blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
With a burning heart
Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
No-one survives
Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground
High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing lazer
Burning glaze
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud
It's comin' - Meltdown
Start runnin' - Countdown

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Force rises
False rituals
Baptises
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
The burning sermons consecrate their sin

You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
You're possessing me
In the night please set me free
I can't resist your Touch of Evil
A Touch of Evil
Touch

Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins
Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see
This day will last forever
Deep in the hearts of men
Courage and victory
Remember, remember
One Shot At Glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire
Fighting on with dignity
In life and death we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel
I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
Fight fight fight
Fighting the world every single day
Fighting the world for the right to play
Heavy Metal in my brain
I'm fighting for Metal 'cause it's here to stay
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting the World
I been fighting
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight
Now people keep asking if we're going to change
I look'em in the eye
Tell'em no way
Stripes on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel not clay
See my brother standing by my side
Only got one thing on ever mind
Radio's playing this nation wide
Turn it up louder till we all get fright
Fight - Fighting the World

Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.
What's goin' on now
Don't ya care about me?
Send the same letter to the radio, Ha!
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head
We all like it - Rock And Roll
We all want it - on your show
Play it loud  don't play it low
Blow Your Speakers with Rock And Roll
We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'
People want music to get'em movin'
We don't want labels
We want music on the cable
We want it
We got lotsa stations

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Always Carry On

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me
Are you ready?
Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man
Violence and Bloodshed
Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me
My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end
Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent
Father, father, father
I look up to you and heed thy call
This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be

Damnation, Religion
Salvation, Fire and Steel

I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere
Holy, Holy War
Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Baptized in Fire and Steel
For the end we bring is soon
Now face the storm
A Holy War
Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Black Dogs howl in the night
The Lion is dead!
A Solitary Messenger
The Master of Revenge

Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.
I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Wheels of fire ride

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes
We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down
other bands play Manowar kill

Built a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind, born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise
With fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting

Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

Brothers the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the Battle Hymns
Into Glory Ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're Fighting the World
Side by side
On a crusade
The world we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king
Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France
Will not fail
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy
Switzerland, Austria
Back to the Glory of Germany
Sound the Death Tone
On our March for Revenge
Spill the Blood of my Enemies
The Oath of a Friend
Fight the Holy War for The Crown and the Ring
Six magic circles made by the Blood of the Kings
Wherever we ride it's metal we bring
Blood of a king.

[PRELUDE]
[I HECTOR STORMS THE WALL]
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
[II THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS]
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
[III FUNERAL MARCH]
[IV ARMOR OF THE GODS]
[V HECTOR'S FINAL HOUR]
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
[VI DEATH HECTOR'S REWARD]
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Die, die, die...
[VII THE DESECRATION OF HECTOR'S BODY]
[PART 1]
[PART 2]
[VIII THE GLORY OF ACHILLES]
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers go on get out
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers I said
There's metal in the air tonight, can you hear it call
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky

The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.
Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me
When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die
Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave
There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind

In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring

Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die
Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine
We are the undefeated we're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel
Livin hard and ridin fast
No one controls our goddam lifes

Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son

In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky
From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion it's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight
We believe in the power and the might
We're here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

Some want to think hope is lost see me stand alone
I can't do what others may want then I'll have no home
So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage ride into the night
Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul will point the way to victory
If there's a fight then I'll be there, I'll be there
So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Lift your wings up high my friend fearless to the end

We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king
All of the dreams held deep inside have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king

I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell

When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
[Repeat 3, 4, 5, chorus to fade]

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
[Repeat chorus]
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song
[Repeat chorus to fade]

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
[Bridge:]
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
[Chorus:]
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
[Repeat bridge, chorus]
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
[Chorus:]
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
[Repeat chorus]
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived
[Repeat chorus, 2nd verse, chorus]

Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
[Repeat chorus]
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
[Repeat all]

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
We know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land

Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin

We are trying to get the message to you

Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Are you feeling the fire, are you ready to explode?
Are your dreams and desires riding down an open road?
I'm like a runaway, a heart without a home
Others can laugh and play
I'll fight for every inch I take, I'm desperate to the bone
Stay hungry, feel the fire
Stay hungry, don't explode
Stay hungry, with desire
Stay hungry, you're alone
Be the hunter and the hunted, keep your target in your sight
Don't be side tracked or shunted, let pretenders feel your bite
And if you start to slide never show you're weak
Don't feel you've got to hide
Remember what you're fighting for, remember what you seek
Alright
If your fire is faded and you can't feel it no more
If you're tired and overrated, let me show you to the door
Expect no sympathy, there's none to be had
Open your eyes and see
There's no room for the wannabees, the has beens or the bad
...

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We've got the right to choose and there ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be just, don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong
Oh, you're so condescending, your gall is never ending
We don't want nothing, not a thing, from you
Your life is trite and jaded, boring and confiscated
If that's your best, your best won't do
We're right, yeah
We're free, yeah
We'll fight, yeah
You'll see, yeah
No way!
We're not gonna take it (no!)
We're not gonna take it anymore (just you try and make us)
We're not gonna take it (come on)
No, we ain't gonna take it (you're all worthless and weak)
We're not gonna take it anymore (now drop and give me twenty)
We're not gonna take it (a pledge pin)
No, we ain't gonna take it (on your uniform)

Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in child, take my hand
Here there's no work or play, only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say as you go down, down, down
You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire, but I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn
Before I burn in hell
Take a good look in your heart, tell me what do you see
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late
And then you'll burn in hell
Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you (oh, burn in hell)
Lay no evil down on me (you're gonna burn in hell)
Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you (oh, burn in hell)
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free
See no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free (you're gonna burn in hell)
...

Oh, it's so nice to see you all inside my dreamy little world
And it's so nice to be with all you lovely little boys and girls
Make yourselves comfortable, my place is so divine
Don't you think I'm wonderful? Say yes! You're on my time
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Don't try to leave, the doors are locked and only I have got the key
Forget the windows, they're nailed shut and boarded up so you can't see
You'll love the light show, oh, I'm sure you'll think it's swell
When they go off, you're welcome to my living hell
Come here, my sweet
Let me help you with that
There, that's better
I'm overjoyed at all the games I'm playing here with you today
But I'm so sad the party's over and we can no longer play
You think you're going home to your own little bed
But that's impossible, you can't sleep when you're dead
...
It happened in the broad daylight
So unexpected came the knife
A child's scream sliced through the air
But no one came or seemed to care, no!
The man's description did little good
A local stranger from the neighborhood
Those little kids, oh, he left behind
With their mangled lives and their tortured minds
Since he didn't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair
Call for street justice
Let no mercy show
Don't let him go
The man was caught and brought before a judge
Who had just returned from a three drink lunch
His lawyer screamed "you must set him free"
And off he went on a technicality
Since the law don't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair
Why should parents cry?
How many have to die?
The mob assembled, smoke filled the air
And marched in anger to do what's fair
To bring to justice this soulless thing
And show the others what evil brings
Now before you shake your head, think if it was your child instead
Tell me what you'd do
Pray this isn't true
When slime escapes the law
We'll even up the score
Please don't let him go...

I wanna rock! (rock)
I want to rock! (rock)
Turn it down you say
But all I got to say to you is time and time again I say, "no!"
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to when you tell me not to play I say, "no!"
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you
There's a feelin' that
I get from nothin' else and there ain't nothin' in the world that makes me go!
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
Turn the power up
I've waited for so long so I could hear my favorite song so, let's go!
When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me
There's nothin' else that I would rather do
Rock (rock)
I wanna rock!
...

How long I have wanted this dream to come true
And as it approaches, I can't believe I'm through
I've tried, oh, how I've tried
For a life, yes a life, I thought I knew
Oh, it's the price we gotta pay and all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose, though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done
Time seems to have frozen but the mind can be fooled
As the days pass I discover, destiny just can't be ruled
Hard times, oh, hard times
For the prize, yes the prize, I thought I knew
...

Look at you, you're my dream
Are you all that you seem?
Now you have what I need, and what I believe
Don't tell me you'll lose it, 'cause I'll have to leave
Don't let me down
What do I have to give
Until you let me live?
You're all that I work for but that's not enough
Do I have to die too to show you my stuff?
Well, I give you my best
So, why don't you understand?
I'm passing the biggest test
So, don't cry, lend a hand
Head held high, heart in hand
Flesh and blood, make a man
If that disappoints you, well, what can I say?
I don't want you to hurt, I just want to play
...

You can hear the thunder long before the storm
But you can't hear the lion when he stalks his prey
He's moving like a shadow, creeping up on you
And like a siren's call he's gonna have his way
You'd better run, forget your pride
Don't make a stand, just step aside
If you don't have what it takes, don't try to play, you'll lose your stakes
Remember this at least
It's the nature of the beast
You won't hear a footstep comin' up on you
Movin' like a snake he's in complete control
This killer knows his business, he is the predator
You are his only target, you're his only goal
What will you say, what will you do?
Your wildest nightmare's comin' true
There is nothing you can say, no way to change, he won't delay
This cain will have his feast
If you play you're bound to lose
Don't roll the dice, don't turn the screw
Just listen to the priest

Black sheep of the family, nothing like the rest
Separate from the others, failing all their tests
Can't they see you're different, so hungry and so lean
You're a walking wonder, you're a metal machine
Look and you'll see you're a lot like me
You're an S.M.F.
You're an S.-M.-F.
Caught up in their worries and tomorrow's dream
Missing all the living, milk without the cream
They think you're so foolish, living for today
Caring just what you think, not what others say
Join with us, oh, how they'll scream and fuss
We're the ones that live it, we're all really free
And if they think that we're sick then sick is what we'll be
Scream it loud, Know what you are, be proud

Gather 'round us, join with the band
Together we're stronger, together we'll stand
Say what can you do, well, we've got a plan
And we're gonna take you to the promised land
It's time to remember, it's time to move on
They've pushed it too far, they don't know what they've done
If it's a fight that they want then it's a fight that they'll get
We never lose, honey so place your bets
Long ago and far away
We had a voice, you know that we had a say
We won't live for yesterday
Ready or not, we're gonna have our way
We got the numbers, yeah, we got the might
We got the strenght and we got the right
We got the reason, yeah, we got the night
So wake up the sleeping giant
Not one more minute, not one more day
We've waited too long, can't let our chance slip away
We won't stop 'til we get it, we won't stop 'til we're done
We'll bite and we'll claw until they've lost and we've won
We took all we're gonna take
It's got to stop, you know there's too much at stake
Who the hell are they to say
What we can do and how we can play
Whoa
Wake up the sleeping giant
Let's push to the limit, so let's push 'til we're home
We've been good too long, they wouldn't leave us alone
It's our rights they're abusing, it's our right to fight back
So rally the troops and let's start the attack
We got the numbers, you know we got the might
We got the reason and we're ready to fight

Oh know, that girl, she's lookin' so fine
I know she knows ,what she's doin' to my mind
Ooh, does she know that I'm wanting her so
Well, there's one thing I know, I can never let her go
Talkin' 'bout hot love, you're making me crazy
Hot love, you're making me bad
Hot love, you're making me crazy
Think I'll go mad
So cool, no fool, she's headin' for me
Can't run, can't hide, she's in everything I see
Ooh, what will I say, should I pass, should I play
But my feet turn to clay 'cause she's blowin' me away
Think I'll go mad (think I'll go mad)
Talkin' 'bout my hot love
Think I'll go mad, ooh
Talkin' 'bout my hot love, ooh
Think I'll go mad, yeah

You saw me comin', you had my number
But you don't want me, could you be dumber
Your eyes are flashin', your lips are willing
But I'm a patsy for the killing
You're so beautiful, so unforgettable
You think that I'd do most anything
Love is for dreamers, love is for believers
Love is for losers, love
Is for suckers
Love is for suckers, love is for suckers
Listen, I'm not some poor fool, won't jump through your hoop
Ain't gonna crawl, girl, to that I won't stoop
So if you want me, you'll have to get me
And if you're willing I'll be ready
To me that just don't mean anything
Listen, well, well, well, if it isn't little miss perfect
And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?
You wanna get back together? You do, huh?
Well, listen honey, I'm just not interested
You'll what? You will? With your heels on?
Oh no, come on, babe, let's go
Here I go again
You know that I'll do most anything
Listen, love is for suckers, love is for suckers
Sucker fight me, sucker fight you (love is for suckers)
Always be suckers and do most anything
I wanna be a sucker (love is for suckers)
I'm a sucker, you're a sucker
He's a sucker, she's a sucker (love is for suckers)
Would you like to be a sucker, to be sucker?
Love is for suckers, yeah, yeah
Sucker

Ow, alright
Hey girl, across the room
Say I'm in love, babe, it's much too soon
But you know I'd give you everything that I have
Girl, do you know what you're doin' to me?
I'm gettin' burned in the first degree
I want your love, never needed somethin' so bad
Ooh, I need your love, oh, I want your love
All I got to have is your love
Ooh, can't get enough, oh, you're so damn tough
All I ever want, ever need is you
I'm so hot for you
Baby love me through and through
Make you love me like I do
Hard night, just watchin' you
Can't take the way that you do what you do
I got to have you, girl, you know you're driving me mad
Do you wanna play, yeah, you know what to say
Come on, girl, I'm ready, come on, girl, I'm ready
Tell me I can stay, yeah, don't you be that way
Come on, girl, now how can you be so cruel
You got me comin' right on cue
I'm so hot for you, yeah
I'm so hot for you, I want your love
I'm so hot for you, can't get enough

Tonight
Are you ready for a hard time, are you ready for the ball to top 'em all
Are you ready for the long ride, are you ready for the rise before a fall
Are you ready for the big game, are you ready for the coup de tat, et al
Are you ready for the long train, are you ready for the final curtain call
Well, we're gonna kill 'em, gonna stomp 'em tonight
Yeah, we're gonna thrill 'em, gonna do 'em up right
Oh, we're gonna take 'em, gonna give 'em a fright
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, we're gonna lose control
Tonight, tonight, we're gonna have you all
Tonight, tonight, you're gonna beg for more
Tonight, tonight
Did you come to see the bad boys, did you come to watch us shake, rattle and roll
Did you come to hear us make noise, did you come to see us put it in the hole
Do you know that it's the right time, do you know that it's the time to lose your mind
Do you know that it's not a crime if you're bending all the rules that you can find
Well, we're gonna break 'em, gonna make 'em tonight
Yeah, we're gonna push 'em, gonna go for the light
Oh, we're gonna stroke 'em, gonna do it all night
Did you come to see the bad boys

Wooh
Always livin' on the outside, never had no place to hide
Feelin' so alone
I got this thing dead to rights, ain't givin' in without a fight
How the years have flown
Me and the boys we never lost control
It's one for all, yeah, we take care of our own
Me and the boys just wanna rock, there's some things you never stop
We got it and we're never lettin' go, just me and the boys
Me and the boys
We make a big noise, we gotta roll
We don't got a choice, it's in our soul
Oh, me and the boys
With our backs against the wall, no way we're gonna fall
We won't go away
Another place, another show, another face, another no
I got somethin' to say
Me and the boys we know our destiny, just how it is and how it's gonna be
Me and the boys take what we need, get in our way, we'll make you bleed
To the victor go the spoil in our creed, just me and the boys
Me and the boys we never lost control, it's one for all, we take care of our own

Wow, alright
I'm not bad, I'm damn good
But I'll admit I don't do all I should
I don't kill, I don't steal
Well, maybe only when I need a meal
All I'm saying's true but there's one thing that I do
And I just can't explain it, there's no way to restrain it
If I quit the rest I still couldn't pass the test
Cause I could not give up this one last thing
I got one bad habit (one bad habit)
I like to rock 'n' roll
I'm not mean, I'm not rude
But just don't make me lose my patience, dude
I don't curse, well just a bit
Somehow "gee whiz" and "golly" don't make it
Still they say I'm bad from the preachers to my dad
Cause I can't give up this feelin', it's just so damn appealin'
If they have their way I won't last another day
No matter how I try I can't stop this thing
I like to rock 'n' roll!
And if they find one day that it eats your mind away
That won't change the way I'm feelin', don't need that kind of healin'
There's nothin' else I crave so I'd trade the life I'd save
For my rock 'n' roll, now come on and sing
Rock 'n' roll (one bad habit)
I gotta rock, I gotta rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll (one bad habit)
Ooh rock my soul, yeah (one bad habit)
Ooh na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na yeah (one bad habit)
I gotta rock, gotta do rock, gotta do rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll

Whoa, yeah
This is the night I waited for
Countin' the days, I couldn't take one more
I broke my back, you know I strained my brain, oh yeah
And now the more I give the less I seem to gain, oh no
Now I'm on my time, I do what I wanna do
It's my time to shine, this is it, I'm breakin' through, oh
I want this night to last forever, oh yeah
I want this night to last forever
Listen to me now
Out on the street the night fills my brain
So many girls to meet, they'll never be the same, ha
My radio's playin' my favorite tune, oh yeah
This is the life, nothin' I'd rather do, no no
I feel so alive, leave my troubles far behind
Gonna rock tonight, takin' every chance I find, no
Let's go
All 'round, 'round the town, up and down, hear the sound
All 'round, 'round the town, up and down, whoa
All 'round, 'round the town, hear the sound, whoa
Come on, let's stroll
I got to have it
I want this night to last forever, I need it, woman, let's do it baby
I want this night to last forever, come on, boys, let's go

When I think of all the years and all the things I never say
How you fought back all your tears and you've never tried to walk away
Well I've been all 'round the world and I've seen all kinds of girls
And there's one thing that I know for sure
That there's no one else like you who loves me the way you do
For what's ailin' me you got the cure
Oh babe, listen to me, please
You are all that I need
All I want is you
All I wanna do
If you turned away from me sayin' this is what you have to do
If you said that we can't be, girl I'd always be in love with you
And if I live a thousand times
I'd be guilty of the crime of eternal love and dedication
And if I only get one chance to know the meaning of romance
Well then I'm happy with my education
Baby, baby, baby, listen to me, please
Baby, baby, won't you listen to me, please
You are, you are all that I need
All I want is you, all I need is you
Ooh yeah, yeah, all that I want, all I need is you

Yeah right
We got you where we want you and we're never lettin' go
Yeah right, yeah right
We've trapped you in our web now, aren't you old enough to know
So stomp your hands and clap your feet, do a dance, hook into the beat
Yeah right, yeah right, we got you now
We've pulled you into our world and you'll never get away
You might as well give in' cause we're big and mean and here to stay
So jump and shout, shake and cry, wave your fist, rock until you die
So stomp your hands and stomp those feet
Do a dance, hook into the beat

Now your ships are burned
And the evil has returned
It will creep upon you
There's nothing to do
It will rip up your mind
And death you will find
Life is just a game
And death is just the same
Within the blood stained walls
In the center of your brain
Demons without mercy
Driving you insane
When the Orders are obeyed
And you have been slayed
You're lying on the ground
Without making a sound
As your soul fades away
You can hear someone say:
Ring the dooms day bell,
Turn the world into hell!

There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Because I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me
I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side
I'm trying to fight
For what is right
But evil spirits pass me by
They do what they want
They just don't care
What you feel or what you say
Where the road is leading us

No... No!
I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars
Who's to run and who's to fight?
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die
Who's to lose and who's to win?
I'll see the light tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life tonight!
Now the chaos has begun, people crying out
You're all alone, you gotta run!
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide
No we never had a chance!
No... Oh Oh Oh Oh!
Take my life tonight

You say the end of time is coming far too near
My love for life is torn in vain through all the years
What's the answer to the question
that we have been searching for
Can you tell?
Don't wanna fall apart before we have a chance
to try again
Don't let it end...
I tried so hard to make it right for you and I
Your sacred promises have all become a lie
Is this your idea of destiny?
'Cause if it is, just set me free
You can not fool me with your stories being told
My God it brings me down, I feel I'm growing old
No, please don't end it now, there is so much more
We can do, you know...don't let it end...
Let's gather what we had and build it up, again
It used to be so good, oh, please don't let it end

In the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall openIn the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall open

Oh Yeah!
I am a Viking I’m going out to war
I've got death upon my mind
As I was leavin' oh yesterday
I've got no fear in my heart
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through the waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah!
I am a warrior my mind is set to kill
Life or death is on the line
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel
I've got your life right in my hand
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah yeah! yeah!
You are a loser and it's such a shame
That you're a fool and you don't know
That I’m a Viking I'll walk all over you
And by my sword you will die
Dragon ships are charging through those waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah…yeah!
No No No… No!

No more will I do all the things that I've done
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find
His soul had wandered through years of despair
Eyes without expression told to beware
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high
To find they're forgotten to rest and to die

Outcast, not knowing right from wrong
Surrounded by women, wine, and song
Never still always on the run
Prince of the night, killing with a gun
Now, he's taken a life away
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay
Renegade, he fled from town to town
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down
For his head, lies a might price
He's a wanted man, dead or alive
Where will he go from here
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...
He's got mixed emotions running through his head
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead
He's on the run, again
Tell me when will it end

Now the battle is over, the clouds're hanging low
Dead bodies lie on the ground
Marched into slaughter, lost souls fought in vain
No glory or pride to be found
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around
Trying to find my way home
Fighting for honour and medals of gold
But, they were to kill or be killed
Slaying the enemy, not knowing why
Keep low and fire at will
Lost out in action, long gone forever
Just a boy that died in vain
His mother is crying, his father not proud
Twisted gray faces in the rain
Trying to find my way home...

Just an ordinary day, all around it seems O.K.
With a normal view
Then you open up your eyes, suddenly you realize
Everyone's confused
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be
Everyone around is sad, but, they analyze you mad
Sayin' you've lost your mind
Seems their lives have been abused
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find
Seems the whole society in the world's insanity

It was you, it was me,
And we would last forever.
Any fool could see, that we were 
Meant to be
Without you, there is no meaning to
My life.
You're gone and it cuts me like
A knife.
How could you leave me?
You don't remember, I'll never forget
You just don't remember, I'll never forget.
Why did you turn away,
Let your love fade away and die.
You became so cold, you made me feel
So old.
When you left, you broke my heart
And just to see.
How many pieces there would be,
After you leave me.
You just don't remember, I'll never forget

You came to me
You said you were my friend
I shared my art and my mind.
You found it easier
To steal than create.
Then call it your's, though it's mine
You can't fight, what is right
Face the truth, liar
You can't feel, you just steal
You smile in my face,
When I turn around,
You stick a knife in my back.
You think you're clever,
You know you're insane,
You're lies are not white they are black.

They all were there, the court was full
The king beside his queen
His love was cold, the fool will dance
for her 'till end of time,
The queen is in love,
The queen is in love.
She couldn't help her burning heart,
And now he's burning too.
Their love was blind,
They will dance until the end of time.
Queen is in love
The furious king now has learned
He sentenced them to burn.
Forever one,
They are joined in death eternally

I now will tell you all a story,
That no one ever heard before.
It is the tale about the fury,
Remember wisdom is your strength.
It said you're such a fool
Just let my evil rule
No, it's burning like a flame,
Now nothing seems the same.
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
It's wish is my command.
Enslaved forever by the fury,
By the fury, no!
At first it came to me in visions,
And that was filling me with pain
And when my fear became desire,
To let the demon burn my soul.
It said "Don't fight in vain,"
"I'll make you love the pain."
I now have told you all my story
And still for you its not too late.
Don't draw your sword
Just use your wisdom
And never let this be your fate.
Oh, no it's here again,
This demon loves the pain.

Born with the fire in my blood,
Can't live without it.
Something that gold can never buy.
It doesn't matter who you are,
Or what your thinking,
If you believe in what you try.
Feel the fire,
Your burning desire.
Fire, I'm burning up with fire
Fire, feel it burning higher
If you are rich, or if you are poor,
There is no difference,
It's still in what you're fighting for.
If you are strong you will survive,
You'll feel the fire,
Burning on forever more.
Feel the fire
Your burning desire
Fire, I'm burning up with desire
You never play with fire.

Everyone is searching for the
Meaning of our life.
Reading 'bout the hell and heaven
Believing all those lies.
Look upon yourself
Imagine you are two
Power lies within this is true.
Can't you see its clear like a mirror
It's all within what you're searching for
Magic mirror, magic mirror
Now your eyes are open,
and you know you were a fool.
You always had the power,
But you never broke the rules.
Power lies within this is true
Magic mirror, Magic mirror
Once again I say,
The strength that we are all searching for,
High and low we all looked in vain
Can't you see, it's clear like a mirror.
It's all within what you're searching for.

In the time, when darkness ruled
No one saw the light
In the cold black emptiness
Victims of the night
You can't fight what you can't see
To be or not to be
In the dark ages
Those evil days will still remain,
Till someone breaks the chains.
Just the strong survive,
You have to try, or you will die.
In the Dark ages

Out of the darkness, the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong
The lightning, strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I hear a rising force
Searching my soul, now I find something else
I take my life in my hands
Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The power is at my command
The lightning strikes, cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
I feel a rising force
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
The rising force starts to shine
A burning inferno, it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind

Look at me, see the love that you're missing
Can't you see that I'll always be there
You can't run you can't hide from the feeling tonight
Damage done. I guess love isn't fair.
Sometimes I wonder who you are
So close, but we've gone too far.
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl.
Lonely days, fill my nights with such sorrow
Shades of grey, turn into blue tomorrows.
Sometimes I wonder where you are
So close, but your eyes are so far.
You're gone and I can't go on and now my heart cries for you girl.

Lost in a dream in the arms of the night
Two lonely prisoners of our own device
Don't let me go. Hold on together
You wanna know if love can be real
I wanna take everything I can steal
Love on the line, it's now or never.
Why can't the night last forever.
This could be Paradise
Holding you here by my side
If we just close our eyes
We'll be in Heaven tonight.
Run through the night down streets of desire
Burning my soul, my heart's on fire
Give up the fight, it's sweet surrender
With trembling hands we reach for it all
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall
I need you now, now more than ever.
This feels like Paradise
I see the world in our eyes
If we just hold on tight

Shades of night, fall upon my eyes
Lonely world fades away
Misty light, shadows start to rise
Lonely world fades away.
In my dreams your face is all I see
Through the night you share your love with me.
Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.
Here we are on the crossroads of forever
Shining star lights the way.
Walk with me on the winds of time
Love's mystery is for us to find.
Until that day, until the day I find you
I won't rest, I won't let go
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you
To warm my heart and fill my soul.

Locked up in chains, backs to the wall
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call
Pushed from outside, thrown underground
Frozen in time we wait for the sound.
Oh, I feel something coming
Looks like a riot in the dungeon.
Trapped behind bars, prisoners of death
All hope is ours, we can't give up yet
Ready to fight to get what we need
Die on your feet or live on your knees.
Looks like a riot in the dungeon
You stand and die or start your running
'Cause there's a riot in the dungeon.
It's got to give, it's gonna break
Dying to live, our freedom's at stake
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood
We won't give in till they've had enough.

I always knew, somewhere in time
We'd meet again, we'd cross that line
Don't need to question, no reason why
The answer lies before your eyes.
Do you know who I am
Do you understand?
Deja vu, dreams come true
I see my soul inside of you
Deja vu, so many lives
Familiar spirits behind your eyes.
We cross between worlds through windows of light
With open arms we hold back the night
The crystal of power we hold in our hands
We go on forever and love is the plan.

We hold the secret to a dream
We keep it wrapped in chains
Locked inside a mystery.
We climb a stairway to the stars
Through doorways of the heart
Step inside, the magic starts.
Gaze into my crystal ball,
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.
You veil your eyes in fantasy
Time to pull the curtain back
Distant worlds, so much to see.
I wanna know you, come on let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you, reach out to these hands of fate
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

Hold on tight in the heat of the night
Baby there can be no escape
Feelings right, getting hard to fight
Baby how much more can I take.
Tell me that it's real, everything you feel
What am I supposed to do
Look into my eyes, touch me deep inside
Let me feel your love cut through.
Oh, now is the time
Feeling your heart so close to mine
Oh, I want your touch, need you so much
Now is the time for our love.
Drowning in the flames, in the sea of desire
Angel with the devil's eyes
Turn up the heat and we fall in the fire
Can't you feel the temperature rise.
Tell me that it's true, you can feel it too
Let me be your fantasy
Baby hold me tight, say that it's alright
You know you can count on me.
When the fire starts I can feel you burning tonight
With an open heart baby won't you let me inside,
Let me inside girl.

Step inside the dream machine
You're on a power drive
Feel the passion of the beast
Watch her come alive.
Oh, you're almost there, ride on silver air
You better hold on tight, she's fire in the night.
Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.
Got your hands upon the wheel
The pedal to the floor
Now it's time for nerves of steel
Hear the engine roar.
Oh, you shoot the thrill, heading for the kill
No control tonight, she's liquid dynamite.
Rev it to the Red line
You're tearing up the street
12 cylinders and she's all mine
She's too tough to beat
Oh, you shoot to thrill 
Heading for the kill
No control tonight
she's liquid dynamite

To be lonely is my only trust
In my silent movies 
I can expose my lust
Taking snapshots in the light
That I do recall when I retire
Playing with my fantasies I let the curtain fall
In my desire
Still I need that touch for real
To discover and to feel
You're the one that breaks my heart
And it's tearing me apart
Making love to you baby
Making love it's all I want
Making love
Every subway-every crowded street
Feeding my emotions
We pass but never meet
My touch is two dimensional
I slowly close my eyes and think of you
More or less invisible
Still you're my point of view
I can't get to you

Come on baby, what's on your mind
You're stumbling in the darkness
Like you're running blind
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
This same old graveyard
on the same playground
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round

Once we were one 
Now we're worlds apart
Deep inside you know you are my other heart
My memories seem like yesterday
Can't believe it's all so far away
All these years
All our tears
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
You said to me
That we hold the key
Eternal love we give and take
It was meant to be
My love for you
Was always true

With your love you gave me life
Not knowing right from wrong
You always know that I'll be strong
You set me free and you paid the price
You inspired me in my art
With the rebel in your heart
You gave nothing for nothing
But the spirit of you word happiness could bring
I learned to always do the best I can
You taught me to be true and I never ran
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Left all alone in the cold
Nowhere to go so I run like the wild
Stumbling, falling
Crying calling you...
As they gave nothing in return
You became their slave although you were brave
You still teach me what is left to learn
Though they brought you to the grave
You will remain to ease my pain

Don't ever try to fool me
Cause I can see right through you
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
Hold me, feel me
Wound and heal me
Mend this broken heart
Though you're near me
You can't hear me
But you tear my soul apart
I can't beat you
Can't defeat you
You just make me cry inside
Don't even try to fool me
My rage is growing stronger
And I can't wait no longer
Never learning
Vengeance is burning
Deep inside your mind
Time will come to
When I'll make you
Stumbling like blind leading the blind

I cast my pearls before the swine
Sealed and delivered
Then I drink your toast of wine
Though it's bitter sweet
I'm eating from you hand so neat
Pennies from heaven
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live 
Judas...Judas
Sightseeing through the lights
and shades of you mighty colonnades
No I got the picture
of the beauty and the beast
I am the lamb...you are the priest
To crucify me
To make a living...Makes no difference
Friends, you are what you do
Some are false and some are true
You haven't got a clue
I'd rather reign in hell some said
Than serve in heaven

I was carried to you
By the hands of my fate
Thought it was too late
I wasn't the type that believed in true love
At first sight
you changed it to the right
I know what I feel
This is real
I give you my body and soul
Let your resistance drop
Don't have to stop
By the siren's call
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I'm not the type to believe
in a second chance
Or in sweet romance
I'm no beginner been fooling around before
Still coming back for more
Today is different
It was meant
I've found a reason
There's more than one season
Time to think it over

My one way ride in dead end street
Leading to victory and glory
You seek I hide you'll find defeat
My future's in the hands of fury
You try - but never win
Can't you see I am the demon driver
Don't lie it is a sin
Cuz you know I am the demon driver
I live to drive and never wait
For guardian angels riding by me
To speed or die I'm never late
Wherever you are there will be

Something deep inside, far from reality
We pretend it never crossed our mind
we feel but never sense
Building up a strong defense
Some say it's our destiny, Lord...
We're living on the faultline
Get out of here
Cry the prophets of our time
Fear the signs
Save those you love and all your children
You life depends on castles in the sand
Don't look back there is no promised land
We don't want to hear that this could be the day
So much for science fiction
as you always say
But soon the day will come
It's only just begun
For the people on the faultline
it's no use to pray
Why living in danger
Why living in danger, danger

Can't bow for a rule
Cause I'm nobody's fool
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win
Sometimes I might be rude
Acting in my mood
I'm trying to be straight
Cause I don't want to be late
There's nothing you can say to make
me feel worse than I do (how are you)
You can't buy my freedom
Keep me locked in your cell
Sad how we waste our energy
When all our days are few (makes me blue)
We're two of a kind me and you
I guess that I'll see you in hell
Who is my friend
Who will remain
Seems like I always stand alone in the end
Nobody lasts until the end
You can't buy my life and freedom
It's more than just buy and sell
You can't keep me locked in your cell
See you in hellOh no, here it comes again
Can't remember when we came so close to love before
Hold on, good things never last
Nothing's in the past, it always seems to come again
Again and again, again and again, and again
Cry out to legions of the brave
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street
Ride out, protectors of the realm
Captain's at the helm, sail across the sea of lights
Circles and rings, dragons and kings
Weaving a charm and a spell
Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Bloodied angels fast descending
Moving on a never-bending light
Phantom figures free forever
Out of shadows, shining ever-bright
Neon Knights!
All right!

In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undone
Oh they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Ooh they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea, oh
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door
Oh they say that it's over, yeah
Yes they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
Poor lost children of the sea, yeah
LOOK OUT! The sky is falling down!
LOOK OUT! The world is spinning round and round and round!
LOOK OUT! The sun is going black, black
LOOK OUT! It's never never never coming back, LOOK OUT!

There's a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the wind won't blow
And they only speak in whispers of her name
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness
It eats right from her hand
With a crying shout she'll search you out
And freeze you where you stand
Lady Evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil in my mind
She's queen of the night
All right!
In a place just south of Witches' Valley
Where they say the rain won't fall
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed, yeah
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness
She can't face the light
With an awful shout, she'll find you out
And have you for the night
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
So if you ever get to Witches' Valley
Don't dream or close your eyes
And never trust your shadow in the dark
'Cause there's a lady I know who takes your vision
And turns it all around
The things you see are what to be, lost and never found
She's the queen of sin
Look out, she'll pull you in!
Lady wonder!

Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's Heaven and Hell, oh well
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
the sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell, fool, fool!
Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on....
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!

Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real
Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Don't you know that I might be
Your wishing well
Look in the water, tell me what do you see
Reflections of the love you give to me
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
So let me fill myself with tears you cry, why?
Time is a never ending journey
Love is a never ending smile
Give me a sign to build a dream on
Dream on...
Yeah, Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
So let me fill myself with tears you cry
Someday, some way, you'll feel the things I say
Dream for a while
Of the things that make you smile
'Cause you know
Don't you know
Oh, you know
That I'm your wishing well
I wish you well
I'm your wishing well

Gather the wind
Though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun and it tears away
And it breaks you as you run, you run, you run
Behind the smile there's danger and a promise to be told
You'll never get old
Life's fantasy, to be locked away
And still to think you're free, you're free, we're free
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes
Die young, die young
Can't you see the writing in the air
Die young, gonna die young
Someone stopped the fair
Die young, young
Die young, die young, young
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!

Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floor
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more
She's got the look of freedom, and it makes you think she's wild
But I can see right through it all, it's the way to have a child
Oh, walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Walk away, walk on
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all
Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls
I've never been lonely, and I can't imagine why
Maybe she could be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die
Can't see her fire
But I can feel her heat, all right!
It's rising higher
I'm walking the wire
Walk on by!
Oh! Walk away!
Oh, walk on by, walk away!
Walk on!
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher
But don't be fooled! Just turn your head and walk away!

It's a long way to nowhere
And I'm leaving very soon
On the way we pass so close
To the back side of the moon
Hey join the traveler if you got nowhere to go
Hang your head and take my hand
It's the only road I know
Oh! Lonely is the word, yeah yeah yeah!
I've been higher than stardust
I've been seen upon the sun
I used to count in millions then
But now I only count in one
Come on, join the traveler
If you got nowhere to go
Yeah, Lonely is the word
Got to be the saddest song I ever heard
Yeah, Lonely is the name
Maybe life's a losing game

A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold, yeah
Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know
So let it all go!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!
Nighttime sorrow, taken like a pain
Black will not become a white, it's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!
If it feels right
Turn off the light!

Say you don't know me, you'll burn
You can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
Nothin' you do will be new, 'cause I'm through
Call me a liar, you knew
You were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
Some can't accept but I crept inside you
So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
'Cause it's Voodoo, oh!
Fade into shadow, you'll burn
Your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till your mine and you learn
So if a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes
'Cause he's Voodoo!
Voodoo!
Bring me your children, they'll burn!
Never look back, never turn!
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo!!

If there isn't light when no one sees
Then how can I know what you might believe?
A story told that can't be real
Somehow must reflect the truth we feel, yeah
Fade away, fade away
Vanish into small
Break the crystal ball 
Oh
It's the sign
Feels like the time!
On a small world, west of wonder
Somewhere, nowhere all
There's a rainbow that will shimmer
When the summer falls
If an echo doesn't answer
When it hears a certain sound
Then the beast is free to wander
But never is seen around
And it's the Sign of the Southern Cross
It's the Sign of the Southern Cross
All right
Sail away
To the sign
From the book, the word is spoken
Whispers from forgotten song
Gather all around the young ones
They will make us strong
Reach above your dreams of pleasure
Give a life to those who died
Look beyond your own horizons
Sail the ship of sighs
Break the crystal ball
I can't accept it anymore
On a real world, west of wonder
There's a rainbow, see it shimmer
They will make us strong!
Don't live for pleasure
Make life your treasure
Fade away!
Eight miles high, about to fall
And no one there to catch you
Look for the sign, the time
The Sign of the Southern Cross, yeah

Close the city and tell the people that something's coming to call
Death and darkness are rushing forward to take a bite from the wall, oh
You've nothing to say
They're breaking away
If you listen to fools...
The Mob Rules
Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same
Play with fire, you burn your fingers and lose your hold of the flame, oh
It's over, it's done
The end is begun
Oh, They're breaking away
Break the circle and stop the movement, the wheel is thrown to the ground
Just remember it might start rolling and take you right back around
You're all fools!
The Mob Rules!

Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah
We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air
In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars,
the endless search for where you are
(sail on, sail on)
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!
Don't sail away on a crimson tide!
Don't leave your heart on the other side!
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire with a special name
Don't ever fall in love!
Don't give your heart away!
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!

Slipping away, just a heartbeat from disaster
Nothing could make me stay, close your eyes and I'll be gone
Turn the page, yeah, time to start another story
Slipping away, slipping away, time to move along
No reason to stay
oh, when I'm slipping away
Take a look at yourself, you've been running in a circle
Round and round you go, you're a start without an end
Start a new life, yeah, from the city of the gypsies
Running away, slipping away, right behind the plow
Slipping away
Nobody to pay
look out, 'cause I'm slipping away
Rockin' the glass, I won't leave you my reflection
A future without a past, no more road to take me back
Come if you will, just don't question my direction
Running away, slipping away, we can find the sun
got nobody to pay
and you're slippin' away
No more running in a circle
it's time to move along
round, round, round we go
a start without an end
so I'm slipping away

I think about closing the door
And lately I think of it more
I'm living well out of my time
I feel like i'm losing my mind
I should be at the table round
A servant of the crown
The keeper of the sign
To sparkle and to shine
Never, no never again!
Listen to me and believe what I say if you can
Never, this is the end
You know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man
Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain
Save me, take me away
You know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!
I've got to be strong
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
Think you're safe, but you're wrong!
We are falling off the edge of the world!
Look out! there's danger! no where to run!
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done
Over, it's over at last
There's a message inside as we build a new life from the past
We're falling off the edge of the world!
Yes, the edge of the world!
It's the end of the world!

Sometimes I feel like I'm dying at dawn
and sometimes I'm warm as fire
But lately I feel like I'm just gonna rain
and it goes over, and over, and over again, yeah
Too many flames, with too much to burn
and life's only made of paper
Oh, how I need to be free of this pain
but it goes over, and over, and over, and over again
Yeah, sometimes I cry for the lost and alone
and for their dreams that will all be ashes
and it goes over, and over, and over, and over againNow the time has come for me to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help
With swords in the night
Oh the last part of the game
Decision of death and life
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight
The final battle cry
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying for all
Children of death
I have a dream the things you've to hide for
Deliver our kingdom and our Reich
Don't fall in panic just give me the thing
That I need or I kill
Don't run away for what have I done
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And you'll leave us behind
And ruins remind of your time
Now come back
Run, run, run
Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Creature is following no place to escape
My last steps will find the right way
Where's the future the call of the blind
Cause there is none to find
Watch the sky you see no light
My weapons burst with fear
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die
For all Children of death
Run Run for the whole world
It's time you cannot wait
Lost Lost in a dark world
You feel the strange but cannot see
Too many battles we carry along from the war
And too many frightens we feel from his law
For so many victories we're praising so strong
For so many blood we've lost
Run, run

Extermination thunder the strange one is back again
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us out forever
Fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die
I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
I find taste on lampskin everything's allright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Now it feel the curse of the child
Dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it again
Fear our returning visions to madness we'll fall
if we can't kill the beast forever we must die now
One has blown his life away
Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die
By a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
little Billy you must find your way
Believe in you we ask for but where
we can never find
there must be a sign for the
Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse
Come to it's world following the sign
Give us the help we're waiting for your sign

Years ago I came back
this has been my hardest attack
A burning fire's in my brain
I could feel the deadly flame
Tales of the magic in my head
to a dark dream I fall in my mind
I hold the key of fortune
To feel the strange thing's in my mind
the stone of Ambar I must find
I'll take the chance that day
Halloween - The wizards crown I'll take on
Halloween
Halloween - But there is no return on Halloween
I'm the servant of the Blind to cross the
realms of death
the gate is open wide you cannot close
His dungeons deep no place to hide
The times have changed he has to fight
In magic spell I fall
Illusions falling in my mind
But where's the key I cannot find
the ritual has begun
The battle has begun
the warlocks time has come
I pay the price I've to pay
Why haven't see the signs
I'm loosing now my life
but cannot die forever life

There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creature will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
Run for the Night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and blooddlust their weapons and madness
you see their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
who the mightiest of all will now
You see them running in the shadows of the night
It is not what it used to be
they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you them running with the wind they
run for the night [3x]

He was born in the past time
To take all our pain
The kingdom of heaven's near
The children of this time
Must die for his arrive
To let all the legends be true
The prophecy said they'll call king of the Jews
He is born now to take all our sins
Three kings were searching for this holy child
The journey begins, he has to die
Healing the cripples and taking our pain
He came for the sinner
But what we've said
Disciples are following
They are calling his words
Salt of the earth and light of the world
Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
Messiah - we are torturing you
When you lose the power of your words
Jump from the temple and angle will save
Show me that you are the son of our God
Now take my land with my power you get
Rulin' the world of tomorrow
Messiah liar our burning desire
He is the king without a crown
We'll set him to his throne
Give me 30 p of silver and I'll be your man
Higher liar the fallen Messiah
Let us see his agony
The things he done are blasphemy
Mob has lost their joy on toy
So let us kill him fast
Now drink my blood for the new testament
This is my body you eat
One of you twelve is the one who betrays
Better that he's never born
Judas you're the chosen one
The world has damned your name
Begin with a kiss
At a cross it will end
The kingdom of heaven we've passed
The sky will turn black and the curtain will fall
The father's crying for his son
The tortured Messiah is finding his way
The journey has come to the end
The twelve ones are preaching the words he'd left
They're changing the way of the world but die for
No

Can't believe the things I see
That happens in the state
By a mortal distance that I can't believe
Self destructive infernal
To save us from the breed
But I know that it is all a lie
Star wars begin now
His bombs come exploding
To bring back the death of the night
No mercy he's knowing
How strong he must show us
For the last film you all get a part
Be by my side
Or you've to die
Believe what I do is the right
Soon Armageddon
Last hours are running now
The final solution begins
The words of a madman
No children to tell them
For what they'll not see in the light
Choose by your voice
He kills and destroys
At the end you must die for the night
In earlier chess games
We're playing the part of a soldier
But now we are not qualified
To save our own life
The traps are all placed by command
They are ready to strike
We live and we'll die
By the lies to believe
Try to escape from this suicide dreams
Or past time will come back again
Hiroshima is a joke to that what will come
At the end of the game we all die
Die now
Battalions of fear
They search and they scream
For the American dreams
The way of R.R.
To show he is the star
Battalions
Star wars
With hands full of blood
He talks about peace
With snake poisoning tongue
He's praying
El Salvador and Vietnam
You soon fast forget
But you satisfy on Afghanistan
You've been the master
You kill with a laughter
Your screams of peace are wrong and loud
Cause so we are and here we are
We scream and shout!
Your laughing about all the fools
Scream and shout!
With power of evil they stand

No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
"All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone"
"Save me your speeches
I know (They blinded us all)
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore"
Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"(We're) lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone
Come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown"
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Immortal land lies down in agony
"How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be"
But even in silence I heard the words
"An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken"
Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
"I swear revenge"
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge
"Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But) freely you came and
You freely shall depart
(So) never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends"
"Oh I'm heir of the high lord!"
"You better don't trust him"
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said
Back to where it all began

Far, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain
It lies unknown
The land of mine
A hidden gate
To save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence
Words of wisdom
I've seen the end of all
Be aware the storm gets closer
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
That tomorrows bears insanity
Gone's the wisdom
Of a thousand years
A world in fire and chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far
Deep down it lies my secret vision
I better keep it safe
Shall I leave my friends alone
Hidden in my twilight hall
(I) know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames
Alone
How shall we leave the lost road
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Even though
The storm calmed down
The bitter end
Is just a matter of time
Shall we dare the dragon
Merciless he's poisoning our hearts
Our hearts

Light fails at dawn
The moon is gone
And deadly the night reigns
Deceit
Finally I've found myself
In these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?
Barren and lifeless the land lies
Lord of all Noldor
A star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord
The Fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
I stand alone
Noone's by my side
I'll dare you
Come out
You coward
Now it's me or you
He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries
Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned
The iron crowned
Is getting closer
Swings his hammer
Down on him
Like a thunderstorm
He's crushing
Down the Noldor's
Proudest king
Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain
The Elvenking's broken
He stumbles and falls
The most proud and most valiant
His spirit survives
Praise our king

I feel cold
Facing the darkness
The light's gone away
Deep in his castle he said
All land'll be mine
There's one thing for sure
The triumph of shadow is near
Deep in his castle they sang
We shall not rest
Until all will be thyne
All land is mine
You can be sure
Don't dare me
the mighty one screamed
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till I'm king
Valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
Rise of Fall
a dark tale ends
just wondering how
in the darkness
they found their way
to the right place
children of the sun
second kindred
we call their race
treat them kindly
born in the east
(are the) nightfearer
they moved westwards
towards the sunshine
(they are) morning breath like
short's their life
(like) dawn passes by
when the day comes
the field was lost
(and) hope had passed away
the sun went down
beyond the sea
dark was the hour
but day shall come again
Clean my wounds
wash away all fear
let courage be mine
noone hears me crying
no song no tale
which contains all the grief
(but)
renowned the deeds
and the victims of defeat
sit down on your chair
and look out for your kin
with my eyes you'll see
and with my ears you'll hear
you troubled my day
and you've questioned my strength
(but) don't mess
with the master of fate
I smashed down the light
and dared Valinor
revenge will be mine
Slowly marching on
still we're marching on

I've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom
I've tasted poison
When I drank the wine of fate
But the fear was in my heart
I realized too late
The house of spirits call
Song of the doom
High's the fee
Soon my spirit will return
Welcome dawn
Your light will take me home
I say farewell
To the Eldar

It cannot be seen but there's blood on the green
Only God knows I'm innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me like the Storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
They're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still instead
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son they're gone
The Sun shines bright and anger rises
Lorn and lonely torn apart
Don't you think it's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
Let's pray that heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror shall honour arise
So let's pray and blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me crying, crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name
That's what the minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord

Run
'Til you find the answer
Time out
For our poor Cassandra
She's fairly safe inside the fire
Inside the fire
Awakes desire
Cruelly admired
They'll torture her soul
And they'll torment her heart
But won't change her mind
Would you like to see me
How I'll cut off
Her head life's a game
A lesson to learn
Don't be shy just blame me
Well, there is no
Need to feel ashamed
Remember the oath
Wake up
It's time to cross the border
Is it true what they say
About the part you've played?
Enjoy your stay here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
Please understand
It's not in our hands
Barren the land
It's all dead and gone
And still the tyrant's face is red
So witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
It's the sweetest taste
King of terror just stop wining
Hold your breath it won't take long
Realize this is your judgement day
In between the killing carry on
There are no rules here
Try to understand
You're the artificial enemy
An illusion we all need
For our sake
We're not allowed to see beyond that's your skill
Will we ever learn the lesson "We can't fly with broken wings"
Break the chains
Time to change
I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part
It's been nice we now get to the climax
Your destination's unknown
Just get out of my way
Don't mind the blood here
(No more gods)

A wooden cup and a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free
It doesn't matter anymore that someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before the Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me, shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
"The king's in town
We need a crown"
I think we all know how it ends
"So we're not going take it longer"
So all I know is I don't care
Now we are aware
There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance I hear the voices say
"We get him home tonight and that's all you need to know"
I'm alone
So I can't stand it any longer
And don't want to see it all
Nazarene, your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you

The faithful crowd is gathered here
Soon they'll appear
The high and mighty show up the king
Is in doubts
"Apart from this beggar here
There's no one like you my dear
Tasting my lips
No one but you and him"
Round the fire everyone should sing
And praise the gracious queen
Round the fire everyone should dance
And we praise the handsome knight
Forever and ever we both will be one
The maiden, the fair and the young
Fell in love
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
There's a moment in life when all the years will pass by
And the eyes filled with tears we once shed
We recognize failures, the desperate cries
Of the ones who believed in our lies
Whenever I'll go you'll be with me
My first though and my last
Though we'll depart in bitterness
One day you'll understand
Carry on
Beloved maiden, mine
Or we have to pay the price
Yesterday's memories and melodies
Are gone with the wind, so sad
Snow-white her hands and golden her hair
But she's not the one
Out in the emptiness where everything's pale
There is no sign of you, I'm alone
How I wish you would be here, I'm alone
Telling me it's alright, come rest (your head)
Come rest your head
I'm alone and sadness reigns in my heart
As long as we live it won't go away
We are one but torn apart
Proudly it stands
Until the world's end
The victorious banner of love

I cannot say that I don't care cause I'm aware
Of everyone and everything they're everywhere
Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain, your brain
The cautious hare cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
(He constantly) knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on
Silent creature, filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease, a release
A vanished kingdom falls
It goes on, on and on and again
It goes on, round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head
Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
I will wait for an answer so far
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation, we're the chosen ones
We're the tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels
Well the time is right you shall be on my (side)
I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen
There is not the slightest doubt at all
Not at all
In lower airs we're ground down by their ignorance
Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer
Round and round it goes on and again oh
I can't get it out of my head
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no
The hopeful he sadly admits there's no hero
No place to hide there is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground
It's you who has said there's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within, it's in your mind

I'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful, cruel but wise beyond his age
My body fails
My soul will (rise)
The end of life's immortalized
Disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
(Beyond the door)
There's something more
It seems there's just one way
On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel
The icy claw in me
For a descent price I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty pawned for my desire
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
And through the hour glass
Everything's grey, everyone's pale
Nor colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold
Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive
Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night
From a distant time voices echo in the hall
"Come and join us, enter life and everything is gone now"
And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and
Its loss in the end
(Unlimited) power in my hands
("Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned")
The claw of the dragon ascends
Each step I take mMay it hurt may It ache
Leads me further away from the past
But as long as I breathe (and) each smile on my bleak face
I'm on my way to find back to the Peace of mind

Cut off the light, take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope is gone
What have I done?
Denied the father and the son
For a moment it seemed
There's space beyond the spheres
Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
(You've been sacrificed in fear)
Now there's one thing for sure
I'm not afraid anymore
Day after day we've been fixed in this bowl for so long
For ages we're captured in shells and crystallized walls
Predestined or punished? By Man or God?
I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
The age of false innocence
(Take it away from me)
(And) for a while astronomy has moved the Earth
And we've turned around the Sun
(Sanctum Officium)
Has made me believe
"We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it to hear you crying"
I've slaughtered truth and I've shattered my heart
Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel, so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree
(Take It away from me)
Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part so we bleed in the name of God
Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven there won't be release
(I cannot) I will not

It's warm and tender but very soon it will turn cold
Shadows stare down from the walls
Out of the mist it's coming closer now
It never rains -- it pours on me
So let the saints
Set up the courtyard, the unpleasant cage
The obvious point is I'm insane
Was I aware whom I has slain, I fear I was:
The faceless
The nameless
The bush set on fire
No one ever dared to speak
"Shame on me, I don't believe
The here and now Is all we're living for"
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Witness my last breath
I do not regret
A word I've said
The strong will survive
The weak must die
And out of the mist
It's coming closer now
Sinner and saints --
The grateful slaves
Nature's law instead of God in heaven
From far beyond
I can hear them sing
I hear angels sing
Songs of innocence
I hear the angel sing
Despite the facts are clear
It cannot be, what we can't see
I must admit, it sounds so sweet
Angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
Far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"
From far beyond I hear them sing
Well we all know there's no other side
It's good and evil
I know right between, there's no borderline
This is the punishment divine
Surrounded by night, I've been offered insight
There is none but the sin of pride
Am I wrong am I right? Am I losing my sight?
Abandoning the superior mind
(Right away)
Through the valleys grey
(I will be gone)
Through the shapeless land I walk alone
I'm left alone
Through the deepest void, a blackened paradise
I walk alone, I'm left alone

Turn your head and see the fields of flames
(Don't move along)
He carries along
(Cause things they will go wrong)
From a distant place
(The end is getting closer)
He's on his way
(Day by day)
He'll bring decay
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight
Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for the starlight we wait for the Moon
The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
we're getting nowhere
We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome
We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight
It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall
Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out
We don't regret it
So many men have failed but now he's (gone)
Go out and get it
The madman's head it shall be thine
That someone else dies hidden in (disguise)
Orion's hound shines bright
Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running, running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided
By the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach
Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra, you may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Find myself in darkest places
(Sister mine)
Find myself drifting away
(Death's a certain thing)
And the other world
The other world appears
Find myself she dies in vain
I cannot be freed, I'm falling down
As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you, my dear
And then there was silence
Just a voice from the other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade
Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of three you've chosen misery
Power and wisdom you deny
(Bad choice, bad choice)
War is the only answer when Love will conquer fear
So the judgement's been made
To the fairest the graceful says
Badly he fails
(Warning)
Fear the heat of passion, father king
(Don't let him in
Don't let her in)
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
(We can't get out
Once they are in)
She's like the sunrise
Outshines the Moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price
(In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat)
Jealousy
(I can clearly see the end now)
I can clearly see the end now
(The thread of life is spun)
The coin's been placed below my tongue
Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side so we can win
Be on out side
(Old moon's time) is soon to come
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man
Roar Roar Roar Roar
Troy (Troy Troy Troy)
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb
(Hallowed) Troy will fall round the walls
Faith is shattered, bodies fall
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out
I feel that something's (wrong)
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept out of sight
We live
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
(Roam in darkness)
(We will be lost if you truly believe)
Troy in darkness
(There's a cold emptiness in our hearts)
That they've gone away
(And) won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite the end is near
You better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The war it is over forevermore
No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied
Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die
(Will) my weary soul find release for a while
Holy light shines on
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
The crack of doom, Father
Your handsome son is heading home
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
(Out of mind)
(Can't get it)
(Still the wind blows, calm and silent)
(Carries news from a distant shore)
(Can't get it out of my head)
Sorrow and defeat

Stop be quite now
Out with the light and
Then up and down it goes
Fly
Out with the light
There at the door
The inspiration I've looked for
The spirit of the youth appears
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe
Make believe
But one day
It all will come to life
Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
Then away we'll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark
In the land of mine
The second one to right
And then straight on
Until morning light
No irritation
No, not the slightest doubt
We got once
Quick - we better hurry
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts
And imaginations
These things will lift you up
What is it like?
You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies
Or things to fear?
For fairies sake I'd say
You better come with me
So soon you'll see
Now up and down it goes
And round
Round and round and round
Praise
To my cleverness
They all follow me
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs
Fly in
Fly out
They'll leave it all behind
No one ever dares to speak...
Life is a map
And it is quite confusing
The lights are up
Now let the play begin
She flies, she flies
Into the light she flies
No words like "Just" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now, now, nowIt's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all
Stand up and shout
Let it out
You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again
You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire, go on, explode

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies
Life's a never-ending wheel, say
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah!
Oh what's becoming of me? No! No!
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy Diver, sole survivor
You're the one who's clean
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you, Holy Diver
Oh Holy Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Hmm hmm hmm

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white
Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail
You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy
Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin
So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right
So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Flying away in the clouds
You know you're losing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow
You can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle

Don't talk to strangers
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down
Hey, you, you know me
You can touch me I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see
Can you feel me?
I'm danger, I'm the stranger
And I, I'm darkness
I'm anger, I'm pain
I, I'm the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away, go
No, no, don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down yeah
Run, run, run, run away

Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all
Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel
And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found
Oh here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one never told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no
But here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
In the middle of the heart
Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right through your heart
And here it comes, here it comes again
Straight through the heart

If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there
She had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And in the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down
It said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away
He was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in mama's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said
You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible
Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and then I took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door
So I go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible
Go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible
I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
Disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me, you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I, we're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear
It calling you beware
Look out
There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark, whoa oh oh

Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
All right
And shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
And I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say, oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh Lord, just go the way you came again
Oh, shame on the night
So I know I'd better run
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh, shame on the night
Here I go, I've got to run
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Well, I lost my hold on the magic flame
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
[evil laughter fading]

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind can penetrate your mind
But sail on, sing your song, carry on
Cause we rock, we rock
We rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices, all giving choices
If we listen, they will say, oh we can find the way
But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
We rock, we rock
Sail on, sing your song, carry on
Ride out, stand and shout, carry on
See how we rock
We rock, that's rock

We're the ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness
That it needs, yeah
We're a laugh without tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming, home
We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never, come home
But the magic that we'll feel
Is worth the lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down
We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
Then quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line
Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies
Between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase
Is worth the pain
We're the last in line, oh
Yeah, we're off to the witch
We may never, never, never come home
Is worth a lifetime
You know we're the throw before the toss
But the only way to go is down
See how we shine
We're the last in
We're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're the laugh without tear
We're the smile without the mirror

You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
'Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn
You're breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, willing to learn

Alright
Dark touches, send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure
I hate the light
I speed at night
At night
Alright!
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've got some stairs to heaven
You may be right
I only know in my world
You've got some stairs to heaven you may be right
I speed at night yeah!
I speed at night night night night night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
I speed at night alright

Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But riders in the night
Can lift you out of sight when they call
That's all
My Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
Then someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
There's no day, no way
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come, steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch?
Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm the poor, I'm the sure
I'm the holy, I'm the pure
I can tell you tales
You just might not believe
One night, one night
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play for
One night touching pretty
But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light
One night
One night feeling pretty
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty in the city
One child went away
And one child stayed to play
Chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up
Where they fall, in the city

Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know, no, no
It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, they'll see you anyway
Evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, evil eyes
They'll follow forever
'Cause they're evil eyes
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes

Can you hear me?
Can you see there's a storm
On the edge of the sky?
Does it matter?
Well, it does to me
And I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder
There should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no-one sees
There is only the dark
Just imagine, will you try?
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine
Not what you want to see

Well, it's been a long hot road I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there, no, no
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light, all right
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out
You've been hungry all of your life, yeah
We speed across emotion
And then we lose our hold
We turn on wheels of passion
That we can't control
So eat your heart out
Run to the shadows and hide
All on fire then he dies, then he dies, then he dies

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine
Then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew
That the chains were on
My, my, my
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand
As it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me
And that's free but still
Your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still, your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
Oh my, the chains were on
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still, the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still, her chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on
The chains were on, the chains were on
Yeah, the chains were on
Seen them walking on the water
The chains were on
Seen them flying through the sky
My, the chains were on
Yes, the chains were on

Who oh yeah another lie another lie

It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door
She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar
The devil of one another
Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody broke a heart
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Without a friend
But they got Rock 'N' Roll
On the night that they cried forever

On the night that they screamed goodbye
They were lost in the dark
And they never returned

There's perfect harmony in the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness hunted by the lion and the lamb ah ah ah ah
We bring you fantasy we bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle or we will disappear never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away sailed away
We bring you beautiful we teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe or we will disappear never to return again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away they sailed away sailed away
And as we drift along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle and a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds and then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness just lost like them and part of all the pain that they feel yeah
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away leaving nothing nothing more to say all the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful and they'll always let you in
But doors are never open to the child without a trace of sin sail away

Like candy emotion too much and sugar can turn to sand you scream but nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain or do we see just what we are we're naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children guns loaded take aim and blow all the dreams away too late for anything better to say hey
Are we just crazy with the pain or do we see just what we are we are 
Naked in the rain naked in the rain maked in the rain
Two faces no fire no traces fever has turned to snow hearts break to show you the way as you go oh

He just wanted her but she wants more so build a wall keep it all to herself oh oh
Always never seemed to be too much reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains sad remains another victim of overlove overlove
He was just the devil in a thing disquise jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page close the cage on another victim of overlove
Overlove yeah overlove overlove overlove overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone and come the dawn you got another victim of overlove
Overlove overlove overlove love love love love overlove

Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back and everytime there's sunshine I'm blind yeah

I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer yeah
I'm another number and you know the numbers must agree but everytime the wind blows I can't fly why
We take away tomorrow and never see the end of today lock it up and send it away forever

I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are I could have been a dreamer oh oh

Give me shelter shelter I can face the day then I'll just fade away give me shelter give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly the fire starts to die you open up your eyes 
Faces in the window noises in the night
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window

I see clearly who's behind the wall yes I can see us all
We're faces in the window noises in the night
Give me shelter shelter shelter give me shelter shelter shelter
Faces in the window noises in the night faces in the window hiding from the light
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window
When the fire starts to die and you open up your eyes there they are in the window faces in the window
We are evil and divine just creations of the mind and faces in the window faces in the window

When a woman cries when a woman cries oh

Silence - we hunt for the queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between
Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play hey-hey
Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Silence - we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold
Oh to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more
More's been empty for years
Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you
Small gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon

Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do
The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spider
Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes
Now I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Don't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wild
Why do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hear
Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
A spider
Inside her

You've made it through another day
Driving past the backroads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you
Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun
We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in
Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
No pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel
Some friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my way
Scream at the crazy ones
Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you
Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again
Again, again, again...

I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night - black as heaven
So no-one saw the gun
Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back around
Clutching to monsters in shadows
I can disappear - gone
Better in the dark

If they take away your song
You can finally hear the voices
Of the ones that don't belong
In the face of the rising wind
We all sing Gloria
Is there flame without fire
Most unlikely
If you're there when the walls come down
We all sing - warrior
Is there sight without sound
But we got rock and roll
Rock and roll
Take me anywhere
Is there someone there
On the edge of the last goodbye
Ah the brave never die
Hey, send your heroes of to war
But whisper in their ear
Never cross the song police
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again
For the sake of the left behind
Soon forgotten by time
So unlikely
Cause we got rock and roll
Take you anywhere
Someone's always there
Bring me anywhere
Rock and roll me, ah

You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push
You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
Go on and push

He'd never tell her lies
And she believed in magic
But when the magic died
She could see that all along he's just been
Guilty - a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty - burn in fire
It's time to say goodbye
Don't tell another story
Another alibi
Now you see that all along he's just been
Guilty - you burn in fire
Guilty - the great pretender
You're guilty - just surrender cause you're guilty
Broken promise
But please forgive again
One more time for me
It's the very last time - you'll see
Guilty - liar, liar
You'll burn in fire
Guilty - just surrender, you're guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty
A liar, liar
Guilty - you'll burn in fire
Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire
Surrender - guilty
So guilty

Oh-oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness
Wakes the dead
Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder
And she's afraid
Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
I'll make you safe and warm
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is no more little girl
Don't see her anymore
They disappear
Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today I heard that she was dead
You can hear them only if you try
Goodbye

Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousine
Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio
But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall
Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no
Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall
Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine
And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah

Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the show
The same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son
I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old time
There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Will you need more?
Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh
Sit there thinkin'
In your room
You feel the pressure
You're goin' crazy too
The walls around you
Closin' in
You need a change
Claustrophobic
Feelin' scared
You need somebody
But no one seems to care
A one way ticket
A change of pace
You've had enough
Can't take no more
Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains
Got this letter
Came today
From my baby
Who left me yesterday
Said she loves
She'll come back
She wants to try
I won't let her
She'll be upset
I know it's better
Than somethin' I'll regret
She's been dishonest
And insincere
I lost my mind
Twenty times a year
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains
Woke up today
I'm alone
I look around
But baby you were gone
But I don't mind
And I don't worry
I will survive
Now that you're gone
Don't need nobody
To hold or tie me down
I broke the chains
So let me be
I've gotta be free

I talk with you
I think of her
It always turns out the same
I changed my mind
Then I'm not sure
Love's got me shackled in chains
Win or lose
We've lit the fuse
I've lost control
Then you explore my soul
In the middle
Of love
Torn apart
Right from the start
Is it too late to be true?
Now things have changed
We're not the same
I lose control
I lose my mind as well
Everyday
Love's got me chained

Felony
In tight blue jeans
I did not know
She was so sweet
What ya did to me
The judge said sorry
First degree
You're here in my heart
Felony, felony, felony, yeah
Felony, felony, felony
Well I was shot down
By a heart so cruel
You were were laughin' yeah
You took me for a fool
I'm struck down
Left lyin' in the dirt
I never knew
How much love it hurts
Harvard paid
Detective man
I'm in his sights
I'm on the run
Those tight blue jeans
That drove me wild
She was just a child
Felony, yeah

You keep me waitin'
Why I don't know
Seems like forever
You know the show
I wanna see you
Don't want it to end
But when I'm callin'
You tell me again
I can't see you anymore
All my friends keep tellin' me, yeah
That I'm just a fool
But baby I can't help myself
I'm in love with you
Give me just one chance
And I'll make it right
Could be forever
Don't tell me tonight

Run out of breath
And I feel I'm moving too slow
Backwards and forwards
I don't know which way I should go
There's a solution
To make all your feelings alright
The music's here waiting
So come on and get it tonight
Live to rock
Rock to live
It's all you got when
You're down on the skids
One way or another
Survive until the end
Over and under
I'm feeling the thunder take hold
Feeling it flow through my veins
Rock will never get old
You're down on the skids, yeah
'til the end

It's late at night
I get that feeling running through my veins
You know it drives me insane
In the car, slam the door, turn the key and I'll be free
On that highway tonight
Highway bound
I'm so alive
I'm shifting into overdrive
Nightrider
Autobon
Route 61
I'll drive this road into the sun
My machine is tired and cool
I don't need to go to school
I'll put the hammer down and I'll leave this town
I'm racing time
The freeway just seess to unwind in front of me
And there's no return
My wheels of love
Fit me like a racing glove
Don't touch the brake
Don't cross the line
Don't make mistakes
'Cause you know that I'm
Here I come
The engine roars
I'm locked inside my doors
On a midnight run
But who knows when
Danger lies around the bend for me
With the morning sun
Pass her by
Faster than the speed of light
You better run
Look out now
'Cause here I come

Demon eyes
And the fate is coming down on you
Fire in her eyes
The love she gives she says is all for you
Come the night
You will pay the price
In the night
No one by your side
She will come to you
She take you down
Seven thunders
In her eyes
And no where you can hide
If you can
Won't stop to look at where she's been
All the same
She's telling lies if you believe its true
Comes the night
She'll take you down
She will come and take your life
She will seal your fate
She threw the dice
Seven Thunders
You pay the price
Now she took you in the night
She told you lies
The love she brings is not for you

Staying out all night dancing
You can't keep them at home, no
She'll tease and smile
She'll play for a while
She's got it under control, yeah
I hope it's me tonight
She's looking for
Oh, sweet young girls
I love them all
Young girls
Driving me crazy
The doctor says I must slow down
I gotta leave them alone, yeah
All I know if I'm gonna die
What way to go
You're driving me crazy
Beautiful ladies
I want them all
I love them all, yeah
I want them all, yeah
Those beautiful ladies
Oh yeah
How old you anyway?

Well I've been trying this for so very long
To make you understand
If you'll fight for what you need
Don't come crawling over to me
I'm not the kind of person who quits
Even when the chips are down
You gotta fight for what you want
Don't give up
Stick to your guns
Gotta believe in what you do
A hard time you've been having
Don't feel bad if you're on your own
If you fight for what you want
Things ain't gonna turn out so bad
You gotta stick to your guns
Well, I'll tell you
I gotta tell you
You got to stick to your
You got to stick to your guns

This town I'm in can't take no more
Decadence is silly
You were my woman
Why'd you have to be so hard and cold
Paris is burning
Want to see it from afar
Want to get to where you are
My life's in ruin
The girl I love
She's far away
The distant fire
Brings memories of the love
That I once knew
Where are you now
Been looking all around
And I can't stay
Help me now
I can't stay
Much more before I fade away
Get back where you are
I can't believe
You'd throw it all away
You know you played me for a fool
I'm leavin' now
This time you know
That I'll be gone for good, yeah
Paris is burning, Paris
Paris [Fade Out]

Desperate living- driving me mad
Writings on the wall
Crushed all our hopes and the dreams we once had
Just to watch them fall
Tearing it up in the daytime
Burning it down at night
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail
Last generation- reckless and free
Up against the odds
Thoughts of revenge are going trough me
Fate lies in the cards
Desperate living- trying to see
Breaking all the rules
Only the strongs are gonna be free
From a world of fools

I should've known better
Should've seen right through
Over and over falling in love with you
Wanting you for myself- my first mistake
Finding out the hard way
Was all that I could take
You were just using someone
And I was the one
She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
You're a devil in disguise
Don't wanna hear no lies- no apologies
Imagination gets the best of me
I'm looking everywhere- still I see your face
I'll never forget you- you put me in my place
I've been hypnotized
Now that is over and I've seen right through
Not looking back again I'll start anew
Was making love to you such a wasted time
Maybe I love you, still, I'll get you off my mind
I was taken by surprise

Every night is the same old thing
Baby I tried, yeah I tried
Let's put an end to this misery
Baby I cried, yeah I cried
So hot - stone cold, why'd you let me go
You got a heartless heart
Got a heart of stone
And it's just gonna bring you down
You tell me things that I know ain't true
Baby you lied, yeah you lied
I just wanted to be with you
You got a heartless heart of stone
It's bringing me down- baby
You had to play the only game you've known
With my heart- with my heart- oh

Somebody's watching me, is it just a crazy dream
Is it my memory, playing tricks on me
Out in the streets in the heat of the city
Here comes the night
Sky's turning grey and black
You knew that you were right
Don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes or I'll be there
Just a shadow in the dark, you've seen this face before
Is it just a fantasy, is he coming back for more
Out in the alleyways, there is no second chance
Moving up behind you, you've lost the game at last

Total confusion- one final sin
Someone's religion and greed
Accidents happen, someone to blame
Who's got the answers we need?
I don't know who to believe
But I know who's gonna set me free
Cause I'll be waiting
When heaven comes down
Ashes to ashes, sorrow and shame
Look at the future again
Angels in heaven walking the streets
Searching for someone to blame
Until tomorrow
'Cause I'll be waiting

You weave your spell
Your eyes they beckon me
Your lips they speak, lies and misery
I know it's wrong, but I can't turn away
The flames draw near, they're telling me to stay
(Into the fire) I'm falling
Into the fire
Your love burns bright, and yet the flames are cold
This time I fear, you won't be back no more
When will it end, your love consumes my soul
Into the fire, I'm being tempted once more
Take me back where I came from
Don't wanna see your face no more
You broke my heart, now it's not the same
I'm falling, again

The shootin's over
The smoke is clear
Another notch in my gun
Another round of ammunition
Before the damage is done
She wanted this
I gave her that
She said she will
I took good aim
She felt no pain
When I started moving in for the kill
Cause I've got bullets
Bullets to spare
I've got bullets- bullets to spare
My barrel's ready
My hand is steady
Tonight I'm ready for fun
I got my finger
It's on the trigger
Another night on the run

I'd like to see you in the morning light
I like to feel you when it comes to night
Now I'm here and I'm all alone
Still I know how it feels, I'm alone again
Tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
I said stay, but you turned away
Tried to say that it was me
Now I'm here and I've lost my way
Now I know how it feels, I'm alone again
I tried so hard to make you see
Alone again

I'm like a wildcat at midnight
I'm like a stick of dynamite
Evil senses taking over me
Gonna let the action steal the night
Turn up the heat
Turn down the lights (action, action)
Baby go all night
Turn on the action
Turn on the night
I'm looking over my shoulder
I'm running reckless through the night
Forever young not getting older
Satisfaction guaranteed tonight

I've been lost in the middle
Always trying to find the wishing well
Running around in circles
Never crossing the line
Don't want to touch you
Don't want to see
You've got a knife in your heart
Don't say that you did it for me
Never unchain the night
Don't tell me that the love is gone
Cause there's always another turn
You know right where you want it
But you never gave it in return
Running me in circles
Always crossing the line
Leave you confused
You took the easy way out
When you looked through the eyes of a fool
Don't tell me that the love is strong
Never, never
I'm never gonna set you free

Clouds roll by as I look to the sky
And then the feeling comes, it comes on again
You know desire burns like a fire, fire of sin
Oh, will I ever learn
You're the only one I could call my own
But then the shadows fall and I'm gone again
I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for things
That I might never find again
Care for you, you know that I always will
I know it's hard for you, my taste for the kill
But then it calls to me when the moon rises full in the sky
You know it's not denied
Will I ever find love and peace of mind
On these streets again, will it ever end
You know desire burns like a fire, fire within
I guess I'll never learn
But when the shadows fall, you know I won't be home
Searching for the things

Toss and turn all night in the sheets
I can't sleep
Night after night don't know what it means
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back, we're through
I've realized too late
That, baby, your love has turned away
In my dreams--it's still the same
Your love is strong, it still remains
In my dreams--you're still by me
Just the way it used to be
Calling your name, but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles, waiting to see you
In my dreams--you'll always be
In my heart and in my dreams
In my dreams--just the way it used to be
In my dreams--what can I say
In my dreams--You're still by me
And in my dreams--You'll always be
In my dreams--You'll always be
In my dreams--your love is strong
In my dreams--You're still the same

Like a whisper, you came in the night
Gone forever, seems you were right
Long ago, thought it was real
Should've believed love's not forever
I'm slippin' away
Can't seem to hold on
Darkness comes, so cold
Gentle one, so soft and warm
I tried to touch you, I meant you no harm
Can't seem to hold one
Save me
Long ago, I thought it was real
I should've believed that love's not forever
I just can't hold on
Now that you're gone

The lights go down
You can feel it all around you
Like a razor's edge that cuts through the air
You can hear the sound
It's coming down like thunder
You don't have to tell me why
You don't have to care
When the lightnin' strike again
And the lights go down
And you might be near the end
When the lightnin' strikes again
You draw the line
And you leave it all behind you
You lost your mind and then you lose control
By the time
That you feel the lightnin' strike you
You know you've been holding back
You've got to let it go

Told you I had to leave, I had my reasons
I said that it hurt to stay, the way that I'm feelin'
It's not love
That left you standin'
That left you cold
Misunderstandin'
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take
Why, baby, why did you make me let you go
And leave you so lonely
Why, baby, why did you have to hold on
You know it's not love anymore
Gave you your last chance but you didn't believe me
You can't keep me satisfied, the way that you treat me
Why, baby, why, stop playing with my heart
I told you
Telling you to be this way
Sayin' you can never change
When I told you
Is he putting you down
Down, down, down

I didn't know you, but I could see it in your eyes
Shattered dreams and hopes, you'd been hurt too many times
Well I've heard your past from a friend I'd seen today
Told me of your heart, that you had been away
How I wish I could take you away
I would show you that my love's not the same
But I see I've found you too late
Jaded heart
You look but don't see
Love in front of you
You can't believe
Love can't get to you
To bring your heart to me
I realize you've heard it all before
Lies and promises, you don't listen anymore
How I hope that I will find a way
To break down all these walls that you have made
But my eyes see that it's too late
How I wish that I could take you away
Can it be that I found you too late
Jaded Heart

You didn't see me, but I overheard
A short conversation was just a few words
A lie and a whisper, a knife in my back
The things you were saying lead me to believe
You want no part of me
Leave me go, turn and walk away, turn your back on me
If you stay, there's just one thing that I've got to say
Just don't lie to me
Don't treat me like a fool
Like the way you used to do
Voices that whisper, dark deep despair
Burns me like fire, these things that I hear
Tell me it's over, don't tell me you care
Don't wanna hear it no more
Don't say you love me, if the feeling's not there
Just turn and leave me, I want no part of you
Or I'll be on my way
I won't be back again

In the name of liberty, we set off to the sea
In the name of glory, fighting to be free
But one mistake can set it all to rest
No one sees and no one wins the game of chance
I need to know
Will the sun rise when it's over
Will the sun rise, will there be a sky
Will the sun rise another day
A simple answer, that all of us should see
Let things be what they may be
Open your eyes, do you think that you're the best
Try to see the light before the final test
Will the sun ride, will there be a sky
Someone is watching, waiting to see
If there's a chance before the sun fades for eternity
Will the sun rise, I need to know
Will the sun rise
When it's over

It's too late to tell me you're sorry
It's too late to walk out the door
Last time, last time you left broken hearted
Only to come back for more
I'm not with you for love
You'll be back on your knees again
Til the livin' end
When will it ever end
You know I can't wait
Can't wait, til the livin' end
It was you that wanted affection
It was you and all of your lies
This time, this time I'm changing direction
Changing the look in your eyes
Got no hope for the future
When you live in the past
Not gonna wait for tomorrowWhat's wrong with our society, is it fear or apathy,
Don't let other people run your life
So those with power don't use it, they simply abuse it,
And believe me that cuts me like a knife

We gotta make sure that this don't happen,
'Cause to me and you it just ain't right,
Gonna make damn sure it don't happen,
This is what I'm gonna do

Rock you to hell, packin' up and shippin' out,
Rock you to hell, hear them scream and shout,
Rock you to hell, but I'm never giving out,
Rock you to hell, Rock you to hell

Did you always do what momma said, brush your teeth and go to bed,
'Cause that way never worked for me,
Now they wanna censor music, and if we don't fight we'll lose it,
It's only entertainment, can't they see?

We gotta make sure that this don't happen,
'Cause to me and you it just ain't right,
Gonna make damn sure it don't happen,
This is what I'm gonna do

Rock you to hell, packin' up and shippin' out,
Rock you to hell, hear them scream and shout,
Rock you to hell, but I'm never giving out,
Rock you to hell, Rock you to hell
Rock you to hell

Is this the beginning of a future
No books, no sound, no rock 'n' roll,
With only a few to fight, the manly
This is why rock 'n' roll will never die

We gotta make sure that this don't happen,
'Cause to me and you it just ain't right,
Gonna make damn sure it don't happen,
This is what I'm gonna do

Rock you to hell, packin' up and shippin' out,
Rock you to hell, hear them scream and shout,
Rock you to hell, but I'm never giving out,
Rock you to hell, Rock you to hell


If you think you're safe at midnight,
That's the last thing you could do,
He'll be looking for that nighttime bite,
He could be coming after you

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire

Look away from his hypnotic eyes,
Or he will put you in a spell
No one hears your last pathetic cries,
Now you live eternal hell

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire

Beware, beware

See the full moon rising high up in the sky,
The mist surrounds you and you know you're gonna die

Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire
Night of the vampire, he's only looking for your life,

Night of the vampire


I left the city for another life, to start it all again,
All I wanted was the solitude, and time to think alone

Peace and quiet seemed the only way, but I guess that
I was wrong,
Now I stand, with gun in hand, I should have known it all along

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

Lust for freedom

I'm imprisoned, shut out from life, but I know it won't be long,
There ain't no way they can keep me in, I will show them that they're wrong,
The lust for freedom will see me through, until I break the chain,
You will never get a second chance, you won't mess with me again

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

I've had enough, ain't taking no more,
The time has come to break the law,
If I give in I'll never get out,
So I must stand, I'm breaking out

I don't need to know what's right,
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom, taking it all the way,
Lust for freedom, somebody's got to pay,
Lust for freedom, the future is in my hand,
Lust for freedom, everyone take a stand

Lust for freedom


When heaven comes down, look out

They say I'm a loser, and it's tearing me apart,
But I'll show them they're wrong, and believe me I don't fool around
One thing you can bet on is I ain't losing heart,
I'm a fighter, and a fighter like me don't stay down

They'll live to regret it, 'cause my time is coming soon
Don't ask me why but I can feel it in my bones
And when my time comes, I'll be barking at the moon
And then my enemies should never walk alone

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
When heaven comes down, when heaven comes down, look out

All it took was some bad luck, and my friends all let me down,
They lied and they cheated, and took me for a fool
Now I don't trust nobody, and I don't want you around
I'm determined to win, and the winner takes it all

They'll live to regret it, 'cause my time is coming soon
Don't ask me why but I can feel it in my bones
And when my time comes, I'll be barking at the moon
And then my enemies should never walk alone

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
When heaven comes down, when heaven comes down,
When heaven comes down, don't be around

'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,
'Cause that's when heaven comes down,
And all who stand in front of me will regret it,


Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die

It's a feeling that I have for music,
It makes me wanna listen every day,
I hope that I will never ever lose it,
That would be a heavy price to pay

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die

If they ever try and take it from me,
I will fight them 'till my dying day,
I know they'll never ever beat me,
I will fight them each and every way

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock me now
All night long
'Till I die

If you wanna rock then follow me,
'Cause that's the way it has to be
We've gotta rock and roll each day,
I don't care what the censors say

I guess I need it each day,
I need to rock and roll, I need to rock

Rock me, rock you, It's all we have to do
Rock me until I die
Rock you, rock me, that's the way it has to be,
Rock me until I die

Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die
Rock, rock until I die
Rock until I die


Hey you, Yeah you. Come here,
You gotta problem? Have now, ha

If you're coming to get me, make sure that it's your day,
'Cause if you're not feeling lucky, then pain's the price you'll pay,
If you ever deceive me that's the last thing you'll ever do,
Then I'll come and I'll get you, and they'll never find out who

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

I'm as quick as a rattler, and deadlier than any snake,
And if you talk behind my back then your back's gonna break,
Don't go looking for trouble, it always seems to find me,
I don't know why it happens, but that's the way it seems to be

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

If you wanna fight let's make it now and do it right,
Out on the street in the heat, you're down tonight,
In the neon light prepare to fight, with saving grace,

As I've proved so many times, no one will take my place

Streetwise or not, your time will come to pass one day,
It's the bitter price you will always have to pay
So come on now, or just get out of my sight,
'Cause if you don't, boy, then tonight won't be your night, no way

So if you mess with me,
You'll wish you were never born
And if you play with fire,
I won't tell you again

You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born
You'll wish you were never born


I'm hitting the street tonight, gotta find a friend,
I just need a guiding light to lead me to the end
And you've been nothing but trouble, I can't take any more,
What do you do when your heart grows cold, no one's really sure

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you took my heart away
Wasted Love - return it back some day
Wasted Love

I'm tired of waiting for you to make up your mind,
You're sitting pretty with your friends from the city,
I'm leaving you behind
But you've got what you wanted, I've gotta find what I need,
No lies, no alibis, for someone to believe

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love

I'm hitting the street tonight, gotta find a friend,
I just need a guiding light to lead me to the end
And you've been nothing but trouble, I can't take any more,
What do you do when your heart grows cold, no one's really sure

Girl, you know I've been this way before
So put your foot on the heartbreak,
Show me the way to the door

Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love
Wasted Love - you don't need my love


Late at night I'm haunted with visions from the past,
They bring back painful memories, how long will they last?
You said you'd always be there, but I fought it on my own,
I guess you made my mind up, 'cause now I walk alone

The bubble's burst, the dream lies broken,
And now I'm out here facing life alone
I guess you took my love for granted,
And now it's turned my broken heart to stone

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want more

Reoccuring nightmare that always come around,
I never will forgive you, you know you let me down,
I lie awake and wonder if I should take the blame,
But it won't make no difference, we'll never be the same

The bubble's burst, the dream lies broken,
And now I'm out here facing life alone
I guess you took my love for granted,
And now it's turned my broken heart to stone

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want more

You let me down, you said you'd try,
But I want more,
How could I stay and hear you lie?
But I want more,
I'll never fall for that again,
I want more,
And so I walk alone again,
I want more
I want moreMuch too long, I've been a prisoner here
The hour has come to break out
Shackled and chained, almost goin' insane
It's better to live on the run
Set me free, set me free
Send me a sign, wanna leave it all behind
I'll be leaving the hands of doom
Rearrange the master plan, take the future in my hands
To be free and not trapped anymore
Ride the sky, ride the sky
Give me wings to fly, ride the sky
I have to think for myself and then act
In conformity of my own thoughts
No one should tell what's wrong and what's right
Why don't you leave me alone?
Set me free
Give me wings to fly
Ride on!

Coming from the sewerage, creepin' through the pipes
Born from modern chemistry, a thing that is alive
Growing in this rotten crap at places no one wipes
Eating rats and stinking shit and all it needs to thrive
The scientists got no way to fight
For they can't find any weak point to get rid of it right
You live your life and you don't know what's goin' on
You just can't stop a-thinking that the officials do you wrong
You're sometimes wondering what the hell bit your baby's arm
And the nuns at the holy mission can't keep the tramps from harm
Even thieves around dark corners too scared to leave the door
Frustrated businessmen needing a wank can't find themselves a whore
You won't believe till you know that it's real
From the pain in your stomach and the horror you feel
You need a shit, so you head off for the loo
You're coming to the bog, now what you're gonna do!
There's the reptile (reptile)
Just see his eyes
Reptile (reptile)
Can you see the beast arise?
Creeping up on you
There's nothing left that you can do
And there's the reptile (reptile)
Hidden till now
But now it's there; you don't know how
Just watch it grow
And there's no more human being left but you
You
Oh, yeah!

We're living in our units
And one thing we can do is
Work for a life without a fate
We don't pay any taxes
But the state is the axis
Of our minds without love without hate
We have a higher order
No one needs to be a hoarder
Our society is such a glorious thing
In our centers, we can dream of
Anything you never think of
You can't say we are puppets on a string
Our minds are kept so clean
Checked up on a screen
They're holy men, they're saints
Without them, we might all fail
We don't know war and crime
Things of ancient times
We just see it if we put on video
The blue pass is for my life
And the red one's for my wife
It's the only thing we really need to show
There are still some without rules
But I tell you, they're all fools
The Guardians will find them as we've seen
We got banks where we freeze them
They get new brains screwed in then
And act contrarily to what they have been
With new minds made so clean
They will be the saints
Guardians of our lives
Protect security
They turn the key and they step in
Controlling you and me
Take care eternally
Puppets on a string

There are phantoms here on earth who take away our lives
They kill your kids and they rape your wives
They rip your flesh, tear your heart, take you down to hell
They don't give a damn on any kind of life
Phantoms bring evil, destruction, and death
Night after night, the same old game
They all look so harmless, but deep in their hearts
Satan is lurking, and he will break out
Always someone at your back
Only waiting to attack
Phantoms of death
The empire of deceivers is built upon your fear
You'll have to lose it, 'cause the end is near
Warheads, armies stand to strike; I know it isn't right
I wanna get out of here; I don't wanna die
Infernal destruction; in fire, you'll burn
Then you'll be helpless, but it's not too late
Stand up right now and you'll be the winner
Or Satan will get you, take you forever
Genocide everywhere
Where's the savior of this world?
Where is he, the promised savior? The one who'll save the earth
Perhaps he'll come to bury us, but then it'll be too late
Who are they? Who are the phantoms who will end our lives?
It's you and me, you and me; open up our eyes
We are all parasites of this world
We shall die

Full moon, standing in the streets
I know the time is near
Incarnate power roaring from the sky
Unrelenting forces blasting through the air
Roaring thunder, lift your hands and pray
Running through the empty streets
They're looking for the fight
Swords gleam in the light of moon
The gods prepare to strike
Metal invaders, ready to strike
A warning from hell, be careful tonight
All right!
Dark night overwhelming bright light
See the demons fly
Can't trust your senses; fear you'll have to die
Super mighty shadows casting amplitudes to ears
Sounds you've never heard that take you high
Time has come for them to rise
Invasion is their doom
Riding high on iron horses
In the light of moon
Metal invaders, the gods on their ride
Sworn to bring metal, mayhem tonight
Tonight!
Tonight...

You're runnin' around in the gamblin' hall
Every night, it's the same
You're lookin' for something new to play
To win and have fun is your aim
A pinball speaks to you
His metal voice is knockin' in your head
You can't resist; you'll have to play
You're just another victim caught in the trap
Gorgar will eat you
Gorgar—man, you'll never win—hey
Gorgar—but you keep on playin'—hey
Your blood is boilin'; your eyes grow wide
Advance—too late
Gamblin' fever has taken your mind
This fuckin' machine, oh, hate
You spend all your money
But you'll never win
You're always the loser
And the robot's voice keeps hammering
Wastin' money for fun every night
Livin' for today, no thoughts for tomorrow
Man, you are dead, don't you realize?
Wake up and live before it's too late
Too late!
Gorgar—but you keep on playin'
Tilt

Fight hard
Live fast
Play loud
Step out of the crowd
Iron
Rulin'
Steel bent
Forever, the faith will live on in our hearts
There's nothing else in all the world
That will bring it down
We will play our wildest step to all around
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood
Power
Burnin'
Brains out
United metallians ready to strike
White heat
Red hot
Mayhem
If you don't feel it, you won't understand
Heavy Metal is the law that keeps us all united free
A law that shatters earth and hell
Heavy Metal can't be beaten by any dynasty
We're all wizards fightin' with our spell

A lot of things occur each day
We've got to live with on our way
There's so much misery on the screen
With commercials in between
And the Russians won't be so late
Uncle Sam don't wanna wait
No matter if you're black or white
You never, ever had a right
And look up to the eternal skies
See warfare even there
What once has been a paradise
Now destruction and despair
In other worlds, the children die
Lacking food, ill from a fly
Oppressed by troops to tame their land
It's all the same again
If any man is free on earth
Then tormentors steal his birth
They slam gun butts in his face
And leave his woman choked in mace
So, stand up for our human rights
Push back this pest of hate
Raise your voice, pass on the light
Unite! It's not too late
How many tears flow away
To become a sea of fears?
How many hearts are torn apart
Till another torment starts?
But before the world
Turns into a sun
All cruelty and violence
On earth will be dead and gone

You, you say, you have lost the way
Got no aim, just livin' for today
Look up to the sky above
And see the morning sun again
You got so much power inside
So cry it out my friend
I'm alive, I'm alive
There's no use in hangin' all around
You're a king, can't you see your crown
Look into my eyes
So many things are waiting to be done
You just need a friend
Together we will sing along
I'm alive

Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground
Oh, I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I want to do so much in my way"
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burning so hot in my head
We got
A little time to build up our lives
A little time to make up our minds
A little time to fill up our dreams
A little time, time

Insania, 204
We've thrown away our former Gods
Controlling our day
We have created better ones
So we control the way
We are the ones with the power
To hold down the enemy
Our Gods are perfection
And they are protecting our lives
We still need some more of them
To be safe from the other side
As long as we're stronger
Nothing will happen to us
Fire flash in the night
Just an evil dream
Holy war in the sky
Never
Insania, 2016
Error in store 103
We watch the sun at night
The pretty Gods we've built ourselves
Now terminate our lives
Silicone brain, powered voices
Are crying attack tonight
Our Gods are now fighting
In anger, burning our world
Doomsday has come
And there is no place to hide away
The future is over
And there is no turning back
Now reality
Twilight of the Gods
Insania's dead and gone
Another world was born
But the twilight soon will come

Here I stand all alone
Have my mind turned to stone
Have my heart filled up with ice
To avoid it's breakin' twice
Thanks to you, my dear old friend
But you can't help, this is the end
Of a tale that wasn't right
I won't have no sleep tonight
In my heart, in my soul
I really hate to pay this toll
Should be strong, young and bold
But the only thing I feel is pain
It's alright, we'll stay friends
Trustin' in my confidence
And let's say it's just alright
You won't sleep alone tonight
With my heart, with my soul
Some guys cry, you've bought and sold
They've been strong, young and bold
And they say, play this song again

If you're out there all alone
And you don't know where to go to
Come and take a trip with me to Future World
And if you're running through your life
And you don't know what the sense is
Come and look how it could be, in Future World
We all live in happiness our life is full of joy
We say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness is always at our side
We love our life and we know we will stay
'Cause we all live in Future World
A world that's full of love
Our future life will be glorious
Come with me - Future World
You say you'd like to stay
But this is not your time
Go back, find your own way to Future World
Life can be for living
Just try and never give in
Tell everyone the way to Future World
One day you'll live in happiness
With a heart that's full of joy
You'll say the word "tomorrow" without fear
The feeling of togetherness will be at your side
You'll say you love your life and you'll know why
Scream it out
We all live in Future World
Come with me
Future World
Future World!

Masquerade, masquerade
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out well disguised
Heat and fever in the air tonight
Meet the others at the store
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat, they have no choice
Little ghosts are making lots of noise
But watch out (watch out)
Beware
Listen (listen)
And take care
In the streets on Halloween
There's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
The spirits will arise
Make your choice, it's Hell or paradise
It's Halloween
Tonight
Someone's sitting in a field
Never giving yield
Sitting there with gleaming eyes
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie
Well, watch out (watch out)
Listen now, we are calling you
Listen tonight, we are calling you
And there is magic in the air
Magic in the air
On Halloween
Black is night, full of fright
You'll be missing day
What will be here very soon?
Changing your way
A knock at your door
Is it real or is it a dream?
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream on Halloween, on Halloween
Darkness, where am I now?
Is there anybody out there?
What has happened?
Am I in Heaven or is it Hell?
I can see a light come
It's coming nearer, it's shining
It's shines so bright
It's shining on me
I am the one
Doom's in my hands
Now, make your choice
Redeemed or enslaved
I'll show you passion and glory
He is the snake
I'll give you power and abundance
He's the corrupter of man
Save me from the evil one
Give me strength to carry on
I will fight for all mankind
Deliverance and peace of mind
But watch out, watch out, beware
Listen, listen, take care
Yeah, it's Halloween

People are in big confusion
They don't like their constitutions
Every day, they draw conclusions
And they're still prepared for war
Some can say what's ineffective
Some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective
Well, your life seems quite bizarre
In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care about what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity
Eagle fly free, let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind, follow the sign
Together we fly someday
Hey, we think so supersonic
And we make our bombs atomic
Or the better, quite neutronic
But the poor don't see a dime
Nowadays, the air's polluted
Ancient people persecuted
That's what mankind contributed
To create a better time
Forever we fly
Together we fly
Forever we fly someday
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoooooaaaaaaa...

When I hold the key to open heaven's door
I will never make the mistake and give it back
When I hold the key to open my mind before it's too late
I will never give it back
There's just one way I see
The way I think it's right for me
You say to me I will repent what I do
If it's right I'll stop before
When I see the light of sun will fade away
And I reveal what I have loved before
It's too late when I can't see the hours I pay
The life I try to give is
All I have inside of me
It's one kind of life for me
This music you hear
The strength we have inside is
So much more than you will know
But if you can't see the life around
You'll always walk alone
Look at the drunk man, look into his eyes
See his strong hands
But tomorrow they will tremble cold as ice
See the drunk man, try to ask him why
He will laugh, and tomorrow he will tell you another lie
There's a fight in his head he cannot win
Getting stronger, makes him mad, burning sin
You... you cannot hide
You... you cannot describe your feelings inside

Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
Everyone could see him fall
And be sure it's been his last hit
He's never been seen at all
Some dictator felt progressive
And lay down in the sun
But his people were aggressive
They killed him with a gun
Sometimes you're wrong
By some things you have done
You see fate is too strong
Nothing's won
No use for a fight
If you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size
Like a lie
It's the rise and fall
The prize for all
That ain't nice at all
Luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain
A little dragon could spit fire
But never so for something bad
He didn't know the knight's desire
To throw a lance into his head
Romeo loved his Juliet
Their parents told them "Stop"
Then it all turned out peculiar
He couldn't get it up
And it's all in vain
When you're living with pain
Reap not goods you have grown
By your own
Feelings you like
Disappear overnight
You sip up every grin
Free to win
You nearly go insane
A spaceman flies the rocket
That takes him to the stars
Thinks his wife is in his pocket
But she's strolling 'round in bars
The king of Los Angeles
Bought himself a teddy bear
And the queen became shameless
She did it with a chair

Once they killed his monster
When he went into a trap
Now, he's making better ones
On a higher step
On a warm summer day
The doctor went away
To a place where he could make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned her once or twice
Now, his hips are aching, what a deal
Dr. Stein grows funny creatures
Lets them run into the night
They become great rock musicians
And their time is right
Time is right
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers
And they do it their own way
They mix some DNA
Some skin and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Helloween
They become great politicians
One night, he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought
Well, never mind
Took a syringe and blew out his life
They become a great possession
They become a great oppression
Time is right, time is right, time is right

Don't turn your head
Back to the wall
Don't close your eyes
And wait for your fall
If you believe that you know in this time
You've got anything to win
If you believe that you know
Then I say, "you'll lose all again"
In this time there's nothing to get for you
You cannot really do what you want
You're a child, a prisoner in your mind
You are a victim of this hopeless time
You better believe all you do has a sense
It's not for nothing
You better believe all the troubles you have
Will play you someday
Why don't you help yourself and do the best
Put all the bombs back up their builders' ass
Why don't you stand up to say who you are
To show the people that paradise is not far
Oh, can't you see we got the right
To look into the future without no need to hide
No, we won't accept what you do
We stand up 'cause we're not the people you can abuse
To say we are here to see the light
No, we don't wanna lose all again
Stand up, you people, to save the world
As good as you can
We are credulous idiots
And won't understand what they plan
We march with the times
It's what they expect and we do
Why don't you open your eyes
To undercover all of these lies
I think you won't accept this
Go oppose with your fist
Fight for your rights

Too late to call for the priest
He is not here anymore
We look at the age of the beast
And we've seen its vast armies form, hear our call
Please, save us, please, save us
In permanent madness we live
No time for life and for love
To take is the rule, not to give
Insanity comes from below to take us all
We believe that the phenomena of nature
Are the expression of infinitive intelligence
We express our belief that all forms of life
Are manifestations of spirit
And thus, all men are children of God
Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all
Waiting for his future and the final call
We stand on the edge of the world
Just one step more and we fall
Guide us and please take our hands
Without You were weak and alone, hear our call
Please, save us, please, save us now
Save us from the gods of thunder
Save us from the dogs of war
Save us from the creeping nightmares
Save us from the evils course
Save us from our own ignorance
Save us from the man in black
Save us from the desolation
Save us from the hate attack
Save us, oh, please
Save us, oh, please, save us
Save us now

Hours of lust, hours of tears
Passing by before my eyes
Today, tomorrow, yesterday, one life
Days of joy, day of sadness
Come and go to pass me by
A month, a year, one hundred years
They fly
One day I will be gone
To lead another life
And this world will stop
To turn around with me
Cause time marches
Time marches on without us all
Never stops, yes
Time marches
Time marches on and on and on
Flies eternally
Times of peace, times of fights
Constant movement is our life
Can't stop no more, not until we die
We long for more
Eternity and maybe there's another life
This one is short, no matter how you try
But never give up
All the hope to lead a good life
No, don't waste your given time
To make things worse
Please, please help me see
The best way to be
Make a change and we live eternally
No more wasted years
No more wasted tears
Life's too short to cry
Long enough to try

From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No-one asks us how we'd like to be
In school they teach us what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
At a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this
I want out
To live my life alone
Leave me be
To do things on my own
To live my life and to be free
People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing till there's nothing more to hear
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
Cause I decide the way things gonna be
There's a million ways (million ways) to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool (million ways)
In the end of it, (in the end) none of us is right
Sometimes, we need to be alone (alone, alone, alone)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Leave me alone

Make the people hold each other's hands
And fill their hearts with truth
You made up your mind
So do as divined
Put on your armour, ragged after fights
Hold up your sword
You're leaving the line
Make yourself ready for the lords of the dark
They watch your way
So be cautious, quiet and hark
You hear them whispering in the crowns of the trees
You're whirling round, but your eyes don't agree
Will-o'-the-wisps misguiding your path
You can't throw a curse
Without taking their wrath
Watch out for the seas of hatred and sin
Or all us people forget what we've been
Our only hope's your victory
Kill that Satan who won't let us be
Kill that Satan who won't let us begin
You're the keeper of the seven keys
That lock up the seven seas
And the seer of visions said before he went blind
Hide them from Demons and rescue mankind
Or the world we're all in will soon be sold
To the throne of the evil, paid with Lucifer's gold
You can feel cold sweat running down your neck
And the dwarves of falseness throw mud at your back
Guided by spells from the old seer's hand
You're suffering pain only steel can stand
Stay well on your way and follow the sign
Fulfill your own promise and do what's divined
The seven seas are far away
Placed in the valley of dust, heat and sway
Throw the first key into the sea of hate
Throw the second key into the sea of fear
Throw the third key into the sea of senselessness
And make the people hold each other's hands
The fourth key belonged into the sea of greed
And the fifth into the sea of ignorance
Disease, disease, disease, my friend
For this whole world's in Devil's hand
Throw the key or you may die
On a mound at the shore of the last sea
He's sitting, fixing your sight
With his high iron voice causing sickness
He's playing you on with delight
Man, who do you just think you are?
A silly bum with seven scars
Don't throw the key or you will see
Dimensions cruel as they can be
Don't let him suck off your power
Throw the key, throw the key
Throw the key
An earthquake, squirting fire, bursting ground
Satan's screaming and earth swallowing him away
You've locked up the seven seas
And the seer of visions can now rest in peace
There ain't no more Demons and no more disease
And mankind live up, you're free again
Yes, the tyrant is dead
He is gone, overthrown
You have given our souls back to light
Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing, girl!
Got me feeling myself and reeling around
Got me talking but feel like walking around
Got me feeling myself and reeling
Got me talking but nothing's with me

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law
I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive
So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight
Oh, I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha!)
I can howl at the rain (Ow!)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains
Love me tonight

Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Oh!
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!
I shall return from out of the... (Fire!)

Just sixteen, a pickup truck
Out of money, out of luck
I've got nowhere to call my own
Hit the gas, and here I go
I'm running free, yeah
I'm running free
Oh, I'm running free
I spent the night in an L.A. jail
And listened to the sirens wail
But they ain't got a thing on me
I'm running wild, I'm running free
Get out of my way, hey
Right?
Pulled her at the Bottle Top
Whiskey, dancing, disco hop
Now all the boys are after me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah!
Oh
I'm running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah, yeah!
I'm running, (I'm running free) ooh yeah
Running, I'm running (I'm running free, yeah)
I'm running, (I'm running free) yeah
Ow, ow! Ow, ow!

I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past
You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair
Torture me back at your lair

The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh
Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old
Oh, baby
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh

Giving a swish with your arse in the air
Don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte, you're so refined
When you take all the love that they're giving
Sticking with every man that you find
Don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte, you've got your legs in the air
Don't you hear all the laughter?
Charlotte the Harlot, show me your legs
Charlotte the Harlot, take me to bed
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see blood
Charlotte the Harlot, let me see love
Taking so many men to your room
Don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a "fiver", it's only for starters
And ten for the main course
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law
With the service you're giving?
Oh, babe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time when you left me standing there
Picking up pieces of love off the floor
Well, Charlotte, you left me alone in there
To make your ends as a bloody whore
Well, Charlotte, you told me you'd love me true
Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh
'Cause you're making love all day
Aw, 'cause you're making
Ooh
Ooh yeah

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought
Oh well, wherever, wherever you are
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head
Iron Maiden wants you for dead
Just come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around
'Cause I'm a wrathchild
I'm a wrathchild
Ah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh... yeah!
Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah!

I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Flee before the killers go free
There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy
I'm running from the Gendarmes
I'm never coming home
Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of
Running from the arms of the law
Running from the Gendarmes
It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that inside my mind
Well, I've got to say I've done it before
They're never gonna find me
I'm never going home

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began
I'm running away, nowhere to go
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know. Yeah
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah

Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ooh, look out!
You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me
I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike
The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oh yeah, I've done it again!
Yeah!
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you!
Aha ha ha ha!
Oh! Oh!

Listen to me, Lamia, listen to what I've got to say
I've got these feelings and they won't go away
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees
Oh, help me, Lamia, or I'm sure I'll die, oh, please
I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be
I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please
Oh, Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh

Thinking of an age old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Is it me, I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led
Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!
Forever now, I can't think why
Or is it me, I just don't know
When you see me walking up beside you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away!

She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form
It's been three long years since I've been gone
I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
I'll never know the reason why I had to go
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?
I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone
Oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?

Walk away, yeah!
Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
Sitting here, think it's gonna be a new day
Gonna get my song and I can't go wrong
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song
What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song
Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh hoo
Ooh yeah
I keep on drifting
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah
I'm gonna sing my song, yeah
And it won't take long
I want you to sing along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
'Cause I'm a drifter
Drifting on
Yeah!

Longboats have been sighted
And the evidence of war has begun
Many Nordic fighting men
Their swords and shields all gleam in the sun
Call to arms defend yourselves
Get ready to stand and fight for your lives
Judgement day has come around
So be prepared – don't run – stand your ground
They're coming in from the sea
They've come the enemy
Beneath the blazing sun
The battle has to be won
Invaders... Pillaging!
Invaders... Looting!
Set ablaze the campfires and alert the other men from inland
Warning must be given and there's not enough men here for a stand
The Vikings are too many, much too powerful to take on our own
We must have reinforcements, we cannot fight this battle alone
They're coming over the hill
They've come to attack
They're coming in for the kill
There's no turning back
Invaders... Fighting!
Invaders... Marauding!
Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground
Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lay all around
The smell of death and burning flesh the battle-weary fight to the end
The Saxons have been overpowered victims of the mighty Norsemen
You'd better scatter and run
The battle's lost and not won
You'd better get away
To fight another day
Invaders... Raping!
Invaders... Plundering!

He's walking like a small child
But watch his eyes burn you away
Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home
Children of the Damned
He's walking like a dead man
If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought, "Oblivion? Well, it beckons us all."
Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?
Oh-o-o-o-o-ooh
You're children of the Damned
Your back's against the wall
You turn into the light
You're burning in the night
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight

We want information, information, information
Who are you?
The new number 2
Who is number 1?
You are number 6
I am not a number, I am a free man!
I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feet
Goin' all the way, I'm nature's beast
Do what I want and do as I please
Run, fight to breathe, it's tough
Now you see me, now you don't
Break the walls, I'm comin' out
Not a prisoner, I'm a free man
And my blood is my own now
Don't care where the past was
I know where I'm going – out!
If you kill me, it's self-defense
But if I kill you then I call it vengeance
Spit in your eye, I will defy
You'll be afraid of when I call out your name
Run, fight to breathe, it's gonna be tough
Now you see me and now you don't
I know where I'm going
I'm not a number, I'm a free man
Live my life where I want to
You'd better scratch me from your black book
'Cause I'll run rings around you

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know
Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight
Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when you're strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me

Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty six
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah!
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done
Sacrifice is going on tonight
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes
666 the one for you and me
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Shadows may hide you but also may be your grave
You're running today maybe tomorrow you'll be saved
You pray for the daylight to save you for a while
You wonder if your children will face the killer's smile
Dead men, tell no tales
Gangland, murder's up for sale
Gangland, where the jail birds die
Face at the window leers into your own
But it's only your reflection still you tremble in your bones
How long can you hide? How long till they come?
A rat in a trap but you've got to survive
Once you were glad to be free for a while
The air tasted good and the world was your friend
Then came the day when the hard times began
Now you're alone but alive for how long?
A knife at your throat another body on the pile
A contract to keep and it's service with a smile
Murder for vengeance or murder for gain
Death on the streets or a blackened out jail
Dead men, gangland
Murder, gangland
Tell no tales

Cold as steel, the darkness waits its hour will come
A cry of fear from our children worshipping the sun
Mother nature's black revenge on those who wasted her life
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice
Sunrise has gone
Freezing up the fires
Numbing our desires
Around the world the people stop with terror stricken eyes
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas, there's nowhere left to run
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane
Around the world the nations wait
For some wise word from their leading light
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools
"Is this the end?" the millions cried
Clutching their riches as they died
Those who survive must weather the storm
Gone are the days when man looked down
They've taken away his sacred crown
To be so free, it took so long
It's not journey's end, it's just begun

I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me
Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God why has He let me go?
As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Hallowed be Thy name
Yeah

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky
The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
It's really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest
They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare

"O God of Earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride"
Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips
The light of the blind - you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn
Go
Bind all of us together
Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
Still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you

As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
"In the name of God, my father, I fly"
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave
Fly, on your way, like an eagle
Fly, touch the sun
Fly

Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
If you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
13, the beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise
Terror, death, destruction
Pour from the eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands
They died, with their boots on
Yes, they died
They died, they died, with their boots on
We died, we died, we died, we died, we died

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

What ho said the t'ing with the three bonce, don't meddle with things you don't understand
Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me
Oh I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane
I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do
Oh they drain my strength away
Oh they're asking me to stay
Nightmares. Spirits calling me
Nightmares. They won't leave me be
All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool
Now I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear
Nightmares. Coming all the time
Nightmares. Will give me peace of mind
Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too
Oh we'll drown together
It will be forever
Nightmares. Forever calling me
Nightmares. Now we rest in peace

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
To save the power of warmth and light
Drawn by quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Discovery of man
And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of light and heat
They searched all across the land

Well, you killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct, Animal supreme
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right
Sunlight, falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Through earth and water, fire and wind
You came at last – nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade and break you both
In two – break you both in two
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on
And it's rolling still

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In a land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called planet Dune
Body water is your life
And without it that you would die
In the desert the planet Dune
Without a still suit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sand riders and the 'mice'
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'
He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars
The time will come for him
To lay claim his crown
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down
You'll see he'll be
The best that there's been
Messiah supreme
True leader of men
And when the time
For judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
He'll make a stand
Against evil the fire
That spreads through the land
He has the power
To make it all end

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Won't you run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout "Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers."
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun
Midnight
It's all night

As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David and you always killed the beast
Times change very quickly, and you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
You die as you lived in a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by no one
You lived for the touch for the feel of the steel
One man and his honour
The smell of resined leather, the steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew to fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the screams of evil men

He threw down a glove, you made the mistake
Of picking it up, now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is done
He'll tear you apart, as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance
Oh, oh, fight for the honour
Fight for the splendour
Fight for the pleasure
Fight for your life
Ready to start, the duel begins
The best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain, then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow
The fighting resumes, a silence looms
The swordsmen move against each other
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow
A stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile, the reaper looks on
Oh, oh, fought for the honour
Fought for the splendour
Fought for the pleasure
Fought to the death

Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances, kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce is black and burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole, and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Tables start to burn
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's a fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
But still, we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number, I'm a name!
Back in the village
I'm back in the village

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Slave to the Power of Death

Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave
Slave to the Power of Death

If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?
Time is always on my side
Can I tempt you, come with me
Be Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go, would you be scared?
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be honestly
Just let yourself go
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong
Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally... let yourself go!
Caught now in two minds!

From the coast of gold across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years
Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave
Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness
Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
Out in the night somebody's crying
Of madness

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?
I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying, I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare
Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided
Oh oh
My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take
Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on
Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace
Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home
One hundred years have gone and men again
They came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone
Trapped inside this prison

When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?
When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?
'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu
Feel like I've been here before
Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before?
Isn't it strange?
Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged
'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

"My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee"
Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander
At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Became a legend amongst mortal men
King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria
By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia
Became a god amongst mortal men
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on
The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory
He died of fever in Babylon

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die
One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep
Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?
Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end?
In Heaven or in Hell?
Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams
There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again

Can I play with madness?
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
There's no vision there at all
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha)
He said:
He said you're blind, too blind to see
Said you're too blind to see
I screamed aloud to the old man
I said "Don't lie, don't say you don't know"
I say "You'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next"
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said "You wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire"
"Listen to me," said the prophet

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know
The evil that men do lives on and on
Circle of fire, my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn
You know, you know
The evil, the evil
The evil that men do

Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds
Seventh son of a seventh son
Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil, which path will he take?
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late
Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman, the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

Now that I know that the right time has come
My prediction will surely be true
The impending disaster, it looms
And the whole of the village is doomed
Why won't you listen to me?
Is it so hard to understand?
That I am the real seventh son
Your life or death on me depends
Suffering and pain, impending disaster
Souls crying, the Devil's laughter
I heard the cry of the seven whistlers
Lucifer smiles, looks on and awaits
I'll take your life in my hands
Your fate, your fortune's in my vision
Heed what I say and you'll see what will be
Please listen to me
Now that they see the disaster is done
Now they put all the blame on to me
They feel I brought on a curse
Don't they know that the torment it stays with me?
Knowing that I walk alone
Through the eyes of the future, I see
They don't even know what fear is
Don't they know I'm the one who is cursed?
Purgatory beckons, souls lost forever
Life after death or heaven hereafter
Heard the call of the seven whistlers again
Now Lucifer laughs, Hell awaits
I had their lives in my hands
Their fate, their fortunes in my vision
No one believed in my true prophecy
And now it's too late

Feel the sweat break on my brow
Is it me or is it shadows that are dancing on the walls?
Is this a dream or is it now?
Is this a vision or normality I see before my eyes?
I wonder why, I wonder how
That it seems that the power's getting stronger every day
I feel a strength an inner fire
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore
There's a time to live and a time to die
When it's time to meet the maker
There's a time to live, but isn't it strange
That as soon as you're born you're dying
Just by looking through your eyes
He could see the future penetrating right in through your mind
See the truth and see your lies
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise
...and be reborn again?

The demon in your mind will tear you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed
Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
My fate is sealed
If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays
The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate
Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?
Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?
So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires

Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath
Your time will come
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame
Brothers and their fathers joining hands to make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

I have sailed to many lands, now I make my final journey
On the bow I stand, west is where I go
Through the night I plough, still my heart, calculate and pray
As the compass swings, my will is strong, I will not be led astray
Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, but I know, but I know
I see the ghosts of navigators but they are lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
Take my heart and set it free, carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days
Where I go I do not know, I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel
I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son

Dying swans twisted wings, beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life, in this garden of fear
I have seen many things, in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more, bring this savage back home
Wilderness house of pain, makes no sense of it all
Close this mind dull this brain, Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real, those who know will not tell
All is lost sold your soul to this brave new world
A brave new world, in a brave new world
In a brave new world, a brave new world
Dragon kings dying queens, where is salvation now
Lost my life lost my dreams, rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here, dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned in this brave new world
Dying swans twisted wings, bring this savage back home

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt
There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted, which are you?
Diablo, come again
To make trophies out of men
Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus snap in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright
Toe to toe, throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will, iron fist
How could it have come to this?

Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now? Is it really happening?
Don't know why I feel this way
Have I dreamt this time, this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face
Seen this room, been in this place
All my hopes and expectation
Looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination?
I just can't take no more
The dream is true, the dream is true
Think I've heard your voice before
Think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream?
Is this a new reality?
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind
Coming to the realisation
That I can't see for sure
I only dream in black and white
I only dream cause I am alive
To save me from myself
I get up, put on the light
Dreading the oncoming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate
Nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head
Dread to think what might be stirring
That my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep myself from drifting
Saving me from myself
Lost in a dream of mirrors
Lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning
Lost, a nightmare I retrace
Lost, a hell that I revisit
Lost, another time and place
Lost, a parallel existence

Azazel is beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a Devil to get ready and take over your mind
You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the only one
I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
Beaten, fallen Angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands
Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no-one knows
Nomad, where you go to no-one tells
Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No-one's certain what your future will behold
You're a legend, your own story will be told
No-one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things, but no-one's seen you kill
Nomad, you're the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood your genius
Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone
No man ever understood your genius
Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no-one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Withered hands, withered bodies
Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty
The punishment is death for all who live
Dreams of desolation
Come the Demons of creation
The killing fields, the grinding wheels
Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you
Before you know the crime, it's all too late

When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?
There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes
We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn
The thin line between love and hate

I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go
And I just feel I can be anything
That all I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I wanna be
Make my wildest dreams come true
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
Out on the road again
When I remember back to how that
Things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell
When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be
I'm gonna break away
I'm out on my own
Breaking away

When I was wandering in the desert
I was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turned my face towards the barren sun
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives
Like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
To wash the tears
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away

There's a darkened sky before me
There's no time to prepare
Salvage a last horizon
But no regrets from me
Maybe I'll be back some other day
To live again just who can say
In what shape or form that I might be
Just another chance for me
A hurried time no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusion
And wishing all my life away
No-one can stop me now
Time is up it couldn't last
But there's more things I'd like to do
I'm coming back to try again
Someday maybe I'll wait till then
No more lies!
They're all sitting at my table
Talking tall and drinking wine
Their time is up just like me
But they just don't know it yet
So just a word of warning
When you're in your deepest dreams
There's nothing you can hide from
I've got my eye on you
The clock is fast, the hour is near
Eventful past is ever clear
My life is set, the time is here
I think I'm coming home
A hurried time, no disgrace
Instead of racing to conclusions
And wishing all your life away
But there's more things I have to do
Don't tell me that this is the end

I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocents, evil took place
The angels were burning inside
Centuries later I wonder why
What secret that they took to their grave
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion still burning inside
At the gates and the walls of Montségur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
As we kill them all so God will know his own
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross
Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars to die and be free
The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan his weapon is lust
Living this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of life
The perfect would willingly have died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of god they had claimed
Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars and to die and be free

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me
And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures – they were undead – all of them
They had ascended from hell
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Have a drink and say a prayer for it
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead

Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights
To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a god to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead

Bleeding you dry from the start
The sum of my parts
To give it away
New life in a day
Some new Frankenstein
Damned for all time
Cursed by the angel who fell
Who saves me from Hell?
And who is my god?
And where is my soul?
Too tired to jump, too young to run
Never-ending, forever searching
Chasing dreams, the dreams of my heart
Always seeking, always asking
Questions right from the start
Out beyond the new frontier
Playing God without mercy, without fear
Create a beast, made a man without a soul
Is it worth the risk?
A war of God and man
I want to end my life now
But I don't know how
Recycled again, a lifetime of pain
The spawn of a man
The Devil has planned

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years
Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again
In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon
Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
But the war, no chance to live again
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go
Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale
Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go
Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat
See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale

Everybody's waiting for something to happen
Everybody's waiting for something to see
Lunatics waiting for bigger disasters
Everyone's waiting for news on TV
Winding lives at the end of the spiral
Waiting dictators with their next big thrill
Everyone's looking but no-one is listening
Everybody wants to be in at the kill
I wait for the signs, they tell me true
I see the signs of the end of time
Everyone's searching, but nothing's revealing
Everyone's looking for the reason why
Everyone's hoping for life ever after
Everyone's looking at death from the sky
Everyone's nightmares are going to happen
Everybody's ripping the mask from their eyes
Everyone's praying but no-one's believing
Everyone's heroes tell everyone's lies
I see the signs of the end
So I watch and I wait and I pray for an answer
An end to the strife and the world's misery
But the end never came
And we're digging the graves
And we're loading the guns for the kill
Can the end be at hand?
Is the face in the sand future memory of our tragedy?

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all
And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war
So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low
You can't protect yourselves, even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals, they laugh right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace
Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore
And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
But the memory still remains
All the past years, not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around
In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun
Spare your life and you choose the destruction of time over yourself
Yeah!

Where would you be without music
You wouldn't be nowhere it all
You wouldn't be here to invest,oh
If you weren't in heaven no more
One for the road
Staring our load
Show us the way
Can you imagine the silence
Well,thank fully we've got the boys
The melody lies fascinated
The rhythm is something divine
Send out a trend of impatience
To see you all movin' so fine
Got to find it soon

Man eatin' momma, steam driven hammer
Sorts the men out from the boys
Takes no messin', all in wrestlin'
Is one of her pride and joys
She a classy, flashy lassy
Imitation sapphire shine
Two faced liar, full of fire
But I know the flame is mine
Rocka rolla woman for a rocka rolla man
You can take her if you want her
If you think you can
You can take her if you want her you can
She's a grip and choke ya
Heavy smoker
Wrong side of the law
Midnight shady
Good time lady
Heavy, ready show you what for
Barroom fighter
Ten pint a nighter
Definite ninety-nine
Diamond cluster
Knuckle duster
Feline on the borderline

Got no silver for my pocket
got no pillow for my head
and the winter it gets stronger
got to ease my aching head
In the morning when I wake up
Got this feeling deep inside
And I wonder if I'm dying
Or I'll got out of my mind
I still get this awful feeling
When the snow falls to the ground
It still sends my sense reeling
Knowing winter's come to town

Now winter wind fades from my face
My heart will no longer race
Sun smiling down from the sky
Melts away ice from my eye
Warmth eases back to my soul
Bitterness shrugs then it goes

I got home late this evening, stumbled up the stair
I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there
My woman with a man was lyin' fast asleep
I felt a rage inside me, control I couldn't keep
She was a cheater
I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door
I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded .44
By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do
I scream you cheatin' bitch here's what I think of you
You are a cheater
They both pleaded for mercy, I said no way
When you do this upon me, you have no say
I treated you so real good, and this is what you do
Oh no I've finished with you, your time is through
If you need a cheater there's nobody sweeter than this one
There's no neater, come on here and meet her
Cheater, cheater, cheater, come on and meet her...

Where do we go from here
There must be something near
Changing you, changing me forever
Places change, faces change
Life is so very strange
Changing time, changing rhyme together
There's nowhere else to go...
This could be or last show
Changing dreams changing schemes... NEVER
We're never satisfied
Love is gone along with fun
Now we're reaching for the gun
Changing cast, changing fast
No more tether
We are never satisfied

What have you achieved now you're old
Did you fulfill ambition, do as you were told
Or are you still doing the same this year
Should I give sorrow, or turn 'round and sneer
I know that the prospects weren't all that good
But they improved, and I'd have thought that you could
Have strived for that something we all have deep inside
Not let it vanish, along with your pride
Now with the aid of your new walking stick
You hobble along through society thick
And look mesmerized by the face of it all
You keep to the gutter in case you fall
I can't go on
I, I, I, I...

Came in this morning high on a bird's wing
Wide open minded,but still quite aware
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning
Picking out landmarks that said i was there
Lead to positions by stern faced leaders
Who never let one smile depart from their face
Then with an arm raised the slaughter is started
One or two crack up and start to cry
A selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow
And every few moments I see a friend die
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight
As into the battle we are all led
Killer, killer, you keep your thoughts at bay
Maiming, destroying every single day,
Is this the way that you get your fun slaying, waylaying in the heat of the midday sun,
Get out, get out, go and do your job
Rape and pillage, squander all and rob.
You make me sick getting paid for murder,
But you wouldn't lay a finger on your mother, oh, no
You'll never ever dream to hurt her.
Hero, hero, you have done so well
So sit back and lick your wounds 'cause you won't go to hell.
Take your medal, wear it now with pride.
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside.

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
So I might as well begin to put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law
So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law

Pounding the world like a battering ram
Forging the furnace for the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction that's second to none
Hammering anvils straining muscle and might
Shattering blows crashing browbeating fright
Fast devastating and desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of truth through each man of this earth
Wielding the axe comes the one culmination
That's always seemed certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad it's the age for the rage
Of the dogs which must fall to the just and be free
Now grate for the vandals who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding corrosive subsiding
That withered and wained till the world seemed all drained fills the bay
Second to none

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back
Grinder
Looking for meat
Wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight
Capped everywhere
I've held my licence
It came with birth,
For self reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions
To the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave

Look around
They're moving in
Hold your ground
When they begin
We can do it
We can do it and if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
Then they can get out of here
Gonna keep on driving
Never stop
United, united, united we stand
United we never shall fall
United we stand one and all
So keep it up
Don't give in
Make a stand
We're gonna win
[fade]

Living after midnight, rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning, then I'm gone, I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one A.M, loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again, loaded, loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Got gleaming chrome, reflecting steel, loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal, loaded, loaded
My pulse is racing, I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up, fit to break
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric, sparkin' power, loaded, loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour, loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
[repeat and fade]

I've had enough of being programmed
And told what I ought to do
Let's get one thing straight
I'll choose my fate
And it's got nothing to do with you
The years are flying by and it's time I got high
Took a sample of the good things in life
This is a chance
I'm gonna take
Gonna get out trouble and strife
I grow sick and tired of the same old lies
Might look a little young
So what's wrong
You don't have to be old to be wise
No I don't care that the people stare
Accuse me of going mad
Just get a long hard look into the mirror
Then, tell me now who's been had
The way things are going I won't get to show 'em
Go single all the time's up to me
So it's off with the ties
No compromise
Wanna taste what it's like to be free
I'm gonna gather my things
Go through the door
Every night I'll live on my own
I'd like to be there
And I'm gonna be there
I got a will of my own
I go as I please
Fend for myself
Pull all the stops, roll the dice
Out on my own, gonna go it alone
When I need it
Then I'll ask for advice
[fade]

From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
At every wind what a stake we're in
Is pain better than the grave
When we talk without amend
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage

Catch the play now, eye to eye
Don't let chances pass you by
Always someone at your back
Biding their time for attack
Check for decoys, stay sharp edged
Double-crossers get your head
Carpet-baggers bluff and strike
Kiss of Judas, spider like
Waiting like jackals to sneak up and trick you
Wolves in sheep's clothing, so deft in consoling
Lurking in shadows, they pounce least expected
When you come to, they'll have gone right through you
Tricksters, jilters play their game
Sleight-of-handers, all the same
Masquerader in his lair
Wants to tangle in your hair

Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
But you don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
Electric eye, in the sky
Feel my stare, always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm elected protective, detective, Electric Eye!

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light.
Glowin' god of Mars
Body burning bright.
Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind.
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power.
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud.
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds.

I've been trying
There's no denying.
It's sending me
Out of my mind.
I've seen reason
Change to treason.
It's losing its sense
Of all kind.
How much longer will it take
For the world to see.
We should learn to live
And simply let it be.
Bloodstone, bloodstone.
In the night time
Wake in fright.
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played.
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made
Bloodstone.
I can't take it.
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that bloodstone.

I move away it don't do me no good
Three thousand miles don't help like I thought it would.
Help me, I'm beggin' you please.
You've got the power down on my knees
Give me some kind of life.
Leave me be.
Take these chains off
Take 'em off of my heart
Reach out to me, as if from the grave
I tried to run but I'm tied to you like a slave.
It's my fault for loving you so
You were so precious, how could I know.
You turned mean overnight
Poor poor me.
I don't owe you anything
Why don't you get out of my life.
Through it all the memories cling
And I can't sleep at night.

I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go.
I've heard the rumours and it seems they're comin' true
do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new.
Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through.
How I suffer for your love.
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried.
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life.
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
You don't know what I like.
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messin' 'round, practice what you preach.
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive

Hey listen don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right.
They're playing at a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear.
Always takin' baby out that's o.k.
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me.
Told you one you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face.
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place.
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace.
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you 'round in the torture before the dread.
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter.
As the sweat is runnin' down your neck
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up.
Oh your heart is pumpin' gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load.
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line.
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake.
I don't talk about it but that's alright
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight.
If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate.

One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough.
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud.
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die.
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'.
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent.
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks.
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again.
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow.
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best.
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.

I'd spend my days alone
I used to stay at home
Lost in seclusion there.
Like I was in a cell
A captured heart as well
Surrounded by despair.
Darkness filled my soul
Losing all control.
Down on the streets below
Bright city lights would glow.
The energy would rise
And through the heat I'd gaze
Still counting empty days.
With fire in my eyes
Living through this hell
Can I break the spell.
Fever.  You set my soul on fire.
Fever.  You fill me with desire.
Fever.  You always get it right.
Fever.  All day and all night.
Then one night as I walked
I heard your body talk
I saw a shooting star
In some magnetic trance
Our beating hearts would dance
And crash down from afar.
Oh how strange fate is
Never dreamed of this.
So destiny has brought us
Oh so close together
We were like angels in the night
Living the dream
At last I'll be with you forever.
And all at once it feels so right.

Hypnotize me
Mesmerize me
Feel my willpower slip.
Light my fire
With cold desire
Losing all my grip.
Eat my diamonds
Drinkin' all my gin
Feast your eyes on
A whole lotta sin.
On no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no got your claws stuck in my
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child.
Took my dreams
And now it seems you're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre.
Stop pretendin'
Got me growin' old
Your tormentin's
Fit to snap my soul.
You took my heart
And left it blown to smithereens.
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh
And drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed.
Goin' under
Hear the thunder
Death defying grace.
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face.
Vivious talkin'
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised, so abused
I'm a human sacrifice.

When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you.
You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You Pulled me back to earth
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future
Will you ever set me free
Take me into your arms again
In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain.

Fast and furious we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate whoever would contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in
Never stops the Way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high
You'll find there's life with victory
With victory on high
Freewheel burning [x8]

Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught
And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode - Jawbreaker
Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down
Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
All your life
Tough as steel
Stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
All your life...

Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figure's primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemned to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives
Now facing one another
The stand-off eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown

When you feel safe
When you feel warm
That's when I rise
That's when I crawl
Gliding on mist
Hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss
Evils abound
In the dead of night
Love bites
Into your room
Where in deep sleep
There you lie still
To you I creep
Then I descend
Close to your lips
Across you I bend
You smile as I sip
Now you are mine
In my control
One taste of your life
And I own your soul
Softly you stir
Gently you moan
Lust's in the air
Wake as I groan
Love bites you
Invites you
To feast in the night
Excites you
Delights you
It drains you to white
You knew at first sight
You'd enjoy my attack
That with my first bite
There'd be no turning back
So come in my arms
I strike any hour
I will return
To trap and devour
Love bites...

Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
And eat me alive
Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver as
You give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as
The rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive

You can look to the left and look to the right
But you will live in danger tonight
When the enemy comes he will never be heard
He'll blow your mind and not say a word
Blinding lights-flashing colors
Sleepless nights...
If the man with the power
Can't keep it under control
Some heads are gonna roll
The power-mad freaks who are ruling the earth
Will show how little they think you're worth
With animal lust they'll devour your life
And slice your word to bits like a knife
One last day burning hell fire
You're blown away...
Know what it's like
When you're taken for granted
There goes your life
It's so underhanded
And the man with the power
No! No! ...

In the last rays
Of the setting sun
And the past days (yeah)
That's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
And there's nowhere to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Then I will wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
And there's no place to go
Oh no!
You won't be there tomorrow
Say it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
And there's no place to go...

I know you like it hot
Love to writhe and sweat
You think that this feels good
You ain't felt nothing yet
Red-hot licks in the palm of my hand
Feel your body quake
As we hit the promised land
I'm heavy duty
We'll rise inside ya till the power splits your head
We're gonna rock ya till your metal hunger's fed
Let's all join forces
Rule with an iron hand
And prove to all the world
Metal rules the land
We're heavy duty
So come on let's tell the world

Why do I have to wait so long
Before you come into my life again
Seems as though forever until
I can be here by your side till then
I think you feel the same way too
You know you make my dreams come true
If you'll just turn on your light
Let me see it shining through the night
When I'm far away from here
I'll hold all the memories so clear
If I only have the choice
I would stay so let me hear your voice

Raise the sights, the city lights are calling
We're hot tonight, the time is right, there's nitro in the air
In the street is where we'll meet, we're warning
On the beat, we won't retreat, beware
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down, ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down, ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Lights are dimmin' and heads are swimmin' as thunder hits the stage
Hell breaks loose, turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
Shout it out, we're all together now
Shout it out, we join as one, one

When the power chords come crashing down
Go tearing through my senses
It's for the strong, not for the weak
In light and dark dimensions
It stimulates, regenerates
It's therapeutic healing
It lifts our feet up off the ground
and blasts us through the ceiling
Between the eyes
I hear it screaming
And it electrifies
Your inner feelings
Hot shock waves charge the air
All heads are banging
Fists pumping everywhere
Guitars are cranking
Heavy Metal. Heavy Metal
What do you want
Ten thousand lights come blazing down
With razor sharp precision
The speakers pour out molten steel
The beat gives double vision
An armour plated raging beast
That's born of steel and leather
It will survive against all odds
Stampeding on forever

Been awake all night, can't get no sleep
I need a steel blue heart walkin' down the street
With your razor nails, and your painted smile
Your gonna get richer, I gotta get wild
Any time you want to
Any way you need
Get your love for money there, satisfaction guaranteed
Wo oh, love zone
You know what I mean
Live that fantasy
I'm behind the wheel, throttle open wide
The gas tanks full do you want to ride
Drivin' in the fast lane late at night
I can't keep my eyes off your red tail light
You know where we're going
I know where we are
Set the rear view mirror for the backseat of the car
In your leather and chrome you're all the rage
All you want to do is get backstage
You heard all the stories, are they true
The rock 'n' roll circus is calling you
When you get there baby
You'll be hypnotised
Never seen nothin' like it no,
You won't believe your eyes
Everybody get in
Everybody get in that love zone

Do you like it heavy
Do you love it mean
Do you want it dirty
We don't play it clean
Standing in the spotlight
Ceiling to the floor
I can see you rockin'
Let me hear you roar
Turn it up
Tear it down
Hammering through
Can you feel the sound
Any day, Any night
Midnight madness
Dynamite
If you want it
Come and get it
Do you want it
Can you feel the power
Blinded by the light
Keep on goin' crazy
Burnin' up the night
Shouting out together
Boiling like the sun
Metal lives forever
Blazing on and on
Do you love it loud

Whipcrack, stings the sky
Don't mess with me I'm danger
The meanest one alive
Earthquake, breaks the Richter scale
The more that you resist
The more the pain you'll feel
I'm blazing on to glory
There's thunder in my veins
And nothing stands before me
Forever I'll remain
Hard as iron
Sharp as steel
Stop for no man
You better beg and kneel
Untouched, cold as ice
I'll turn your blood to water
Strangle in my vice
Shock waves, bones to dust
You're messin' with a mine field
so expect the worst
As I destroy, last thing you'll hear me cry, is victory, is victory

As the sun goes down, I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life, hangs by a thread
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting
Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice
Not begging you
I'm telling you
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me,
Under blood red skies
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night
They're closing in
They'll never win
You won't make me,
As the end is drawing near
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand, I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down
just I'll face you under
Hands of justice
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear

The greatest times, I've ever known
They're locked inside o' me
And carved out of stone
I've broken hearts
Made people sing
I've drove a million miles
I've done everything
I'm a rocker, Oh oh
Do as I feel as I say
And no one can take that away
Bring on the night
That's when I live
I come alive inside
Give all I can give
I live each day
Like it's my last
I live for rock and roll
I never look back
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

The greatest times, I've ever known

I've drove a million miles
I've done everything

I never look back
I'm a rocker
And I'm always revvin' up
I can never get enough
It's something in my blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

You get me up, then we both get down
We roll all night makin' heavy sounds
I'm all tied up on your bed
I'd rather be inside your head
Don't do this, do it like that oh yeah
You've hit the spot, give it all you got
I don't care
I'll teach you a lesson
That you won't forget
Why don't you save your breath
'Cause I'm gonna love ya' to death
I'm comin' to the point, I can't hold back
Then you ease off with your attack
You're the best I've had if you please
You never stop, you great big tease
You can take me places, I thought I'd never go
And when you turn your love on me
Baby you're the star of the show

It started many years ago, out of the black country
The seed became the embryo, for all on earth to see
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth, all
corners of the land
And soon the thing began to grow, and get right out of
hand
From the concrete jungle
The smoke, the dirt, the grime
Could not contain the hunger
It grew and grew in time, into a
Monster, Monster of rock
They could never bind it
It vowed to reach the top
Impossible to stop
Took the sound across the seas, the people stood in
awe
At last the sound had come to them
That they'd been waiting for
And millions roared, and millions cheered
This spectacle on stage
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore en-captured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Pain! Pain!
Killer! Killer!
Can't stop the Painkiller!
Pain!

Like wild fire
Comes roaring
Mad whirlwind
Burning the road
Black thunder
White lightning
Speed demons cry
The Hell Patrol
Night riders
Death dealers
Storm bringers
Tear up the ground
Fist flying
Eyes blazing
They're glory bound
Brutalize you
Neutralize you
Gonna go for your throat as you choke
Then they'll vaporapeize you
Terrorize you
Pulverize you
Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
And they'll paratamize you
Crome Masters
Steel Warriors
Soul Stealers
Ripping out hearts
They're Devil Dogs

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All Guns, All Guns Blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

Hero of the night
Blood and thunder
Rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge
Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight
Leather Rebel
Lightning in the dark
With a burning heart
Master of the streets
Bullet proof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No-one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
No-one survives
Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground
High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing lazer
Burning glaze
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud
It's comin' - Meltdown
Start runnin' - Countdown

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
"Come to me" it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Storm warning
But there's no fear
Lies forming
The sacrament lays bare
The sinner
Will testify
They'll suffer
When sacrificed on high
The burning sermons purge their evil words
Between the Hammer and the Anvil
Force rises
False rituals
Baptises
The body and the soul
Our union
Their fall from grace
Confession (confess your sins)
Will seal them to their fate
The burning sermons will survive their curse
Transgression
They prey on grief
Our mission
To purify belief
This altar
Gives power and light
They'll falter
While we are shining bright
The burning sermons consecrate their sin

You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
You're possessing me
In the night please set me free
I can't resist your Touch of Evil
A Touch of Evil
Touch

Let me hear the battle cry
Calling on the wind
Let me see the banners fly
Before the storm begins
Let me feel the spirits soar
Destroy the enemy
Striking at the evil core
For all the world to see
This day will last forever
Deep in the hearts of men
Courage and victory
Remember, remember
One Shot At Glory
In the crossfire overhead
Fate stands before me
Words have all been said
Driving hard and seeing red
Destiny calls me
One night of fire
Fighting on with dignity
In life and death we deal
The power and the majesty
Amidst the blood and steel
I still hear the battle cry
The call goes on and on
I still see the banners fly
The battle's always won
Fight fight fight
Fighting the world every single day
Fighting the world for the right to play
Heavy Metal in my brain
I'm fighting for Metal 'cause it's here to stay
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World
I been fighting the World
I been fighting
Fight for a living - Fighting the World
Fight
Now people keep asking if we're going to change
I look'em in the eye
Tell'em no way
Stripes on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel not clay
See my brother standing by my side
Only got one thing on ever mind
Radio's playing this nation wide
Turn it up louder till we all get fright
Fight - Fighting the World

Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.
What's goin' on now
Don't ya care about me?
Send the same letter to the radio, Ha!
But my party went dead
Like a shot in the head
We all like it - Rock And Roll
We all want it - on your show
Play it loud  don't play it low
Blow Your Speakers with Rock And Roll
We got lots of stations
Around the nation
And the stuff they're playin'
It just ain't worth sayin'
People want music to get'em movin'
We don't want labels
We want music on the cable
We want it
We got lotsa stations

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On
Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Yea, be my brother
Fight to stay alive
All the world can't change us
With all their burned-out jive
Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide
Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders
We can't all be wrong
Always Carry On

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me
Are you ready?
Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man
Violence and Bloodshed
Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me
My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end
Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent
Father, father, father
I look up to you and heed thy call
This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be

Damnation, Religion
Salvation, Fire and Steel

I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere
Holy, Holy War
Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Baptized in Fire and Steel
For the end we bring is soon
Now face the storm
A Holy War
Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Black Dogs howl in the night
The Lion is dead!
A Solitary Messenger
The Master of Revenge

Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.
I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Wheels of fire ride

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes
We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down
other bands play Manowar kill

Built a fire a thousand miles away
To light my long way home
I ride a comet, my trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind, born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise
With fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come

But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill

- Grandfather, tell me a story!
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story!
- A real story?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back with me, a long way in time...
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom!!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...
Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.
Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land!
- Well that's it. Did you like the story?
- Yeah, it was great!
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather?
- Yes?
- Who were those four men?
- Who were they? They were the Metal Kings!!!!!!

Brothers the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the Battle Hymns
Into Glory Ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're Fighting the World
Side by side
On a crusade
The world we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king
Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France
Will not fail
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy
Switzerland, Austria
Back to the Glory of Germany
Sound the Death Tone
On our March for Revenge
Spill the Blood of my Enemies
The Oath of a Friend
Fight the Holy War for The Crown and the Ring
Six magic circles made by the Blood of the Kings
Wherever we ride it's metal we bring
Blood of a king.

[PRELUDE]
[I HECTOR STORMS THE WALL]
I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
[II THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS]
Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
[III FUNERAL MARCH]
[IV ARMOR OF THE GODS]
[V HECTOR'S FINAL HOUR]
Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
[VI DEATH HECTOR'S REWARD]
Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Die, die, die...
[VII THE DESECRATION OF HECTOR'S BODY]
[PART 1]
[PART 2]
[VIII THE GLORY OF ACHILLES]
The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers go on get out
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers I said
There's metal in the air tonight, can you hear it call
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!
Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky

The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.
Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me
When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die
Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave
There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand glory and a broken sword.
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled!
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul
From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind

In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring

Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die
Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine
We are the undefeated we're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel
Livin hard and ridin fast
No one controls our goddam lifes

Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son

In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky
From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion it's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight
We believe in the power and the might
We're here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

Some want to think hope is lost see me stand alone
I can't do what others may want then I'll have no home
So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage ride into the night
Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul will point the way to victory
If there's a fight then I'll be there, I'll be there
So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Lift your wings up high my friend fearless to the end

We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest
The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay
Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1
Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king
Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king
All of the dreams held deep inside have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king

I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell

When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel
[Repeat 3, 4, 5, chorus to fade]

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free
[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years
[Repeat chorus]
Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song
[Repeat chorus to fade]

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell
[Bridge:]
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky
[Chorus:]
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die
[Repeat bridge, chorus]
Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky
[Chorus:]
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die
[Repeat chorus]
If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel
[Repeat chorus to fade]

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die
[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived
[Repeat chorus, 2nd verse, chorus]

Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget
[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night
[Repeat chorus]
Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die
Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
[Repeat all]

No life till leather
We are gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right well alright
When we start to rock
We never want to stop again
Hit the lights
We know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today the only way
With all our screaming
We are gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain Oh sweet pain

By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

We are trying to get the message to you

Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

Cause now you have got the fight of your life
Time
Has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
Now there is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Down in the depths of my fiery home
The summons bell will chime
Tempting you and all the earth
to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one
You people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate
to pull you down into this pit
So come on
Jump in the Fire
With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man
and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out
And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say
Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

Late at night, all systems go
You’ve come to see the show
We do our best, you’re the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckin’ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad
Adrenaline starts to flow
You’re thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash
Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It’s hot as hell tonight
Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Now’s the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin’ loose
We’re gathered here to maim and kill
‘Cause this is what we choose
Here we go
The show is through, the metal’s gone
It’s time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But we’ll never stop
We’ll never quit
‘Cause we’re Metallica

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
To control the land
Crushing metal strikes
On this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
The fist of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one
War without end
No remorse No repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day Another death
Another sorrow Another breath
Blood feeds the war machine
as it eats its way across the land
No remorse is the one command
Only the strong survive
No will to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face
Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
with madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse

Alright
We’re scanning the scene in the city tonight
We’re looking for you to start up a fight
There’s an evil feeling in our brains
But it’s nothing new, you know it drives us insane
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Searching
Seek and destroy
There is no escape and that’s for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You’ve always been taking but now you’re giving
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don’t try running away ‘cause you’re the one we will find

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you
Metal Militia
Chained and shadowed to be left behind
nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metallization of your inner soul
twisting and turning
We are as one as we all are the same
fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
with our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Thunder and lightning the gods take revenge
Senseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing
On through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Do unto others as they've done to you
But what the hell is this world coming to?
Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest
Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Bursting with fear
We all shall die
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past
Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath
Fight

Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me
Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me
Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you?"
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame
Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?
Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore
Freezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say
Scream
From my soul
Fate
Mystified
Hell
Forever more
No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Feel no pain, but my life ain't easy
I know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end
To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity
Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life's for my own, to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you
Feed my brain with your so-called standards
Who says that I ain't right?
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight
See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground
Life's for my own, to live my own way 

Slaves
Hebrews born to serve, to the pharaoh
Heed
To his every word, live in fear
Faith
Of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait
Something must be done, four hundred years
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
To kill the first born pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
Now
Let my people go, Land Of Goshen
Go
I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood
Running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague
Darkness three days long, hail to fire
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
I
Rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born
I shall soon be there, deadly mass
Creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Lamb's blood, painted door, I shall pass

Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me
Battery
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery
Battery 

End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing you
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Master
Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches
Lurking beneath the sea
Great old one
Forbidden site
He searches
Hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death
Timeless sleep
Has been upset
He awakens
Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, No windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says Rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay
Now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son
But he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care
Do just as we say
Finished here
Greetings, Death
He's yours to take away
Back to the front
You will do what I say, when I say
You will die when I say, you must die
You coward
You servant
You blind man
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green
Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution
And you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, Fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow
Lie

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage Incorporated
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution’s end
Never will it mend
Never
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Blackened
Opposition...contradiction...premonition...compromise
Agitation...violation...mutilation...planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered earth
True death of life
Termination...expiration...cancellation...human race
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you’ll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can’t believe the things you say
I can’t believe
I can’t believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost
Justice is raped
Justice is gone
Pulling your strings
Justice is done
Seeking no truth
Winning is all
Find it so grim
So true
So real
Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds
Lady Justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you’re done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell
Cannot feel
I can’t believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd
Doesn’t matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it’s done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice
Choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech
Speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
Your silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom’s ring
Freedom no longer frees you

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Oh please, God, help me
Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine
Has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witchhunt riding through
The shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for you
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You’re living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
Shortest straw has been pulled for you
Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You’re reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I’ve loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger
Misery
You’ll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Pure black, looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be
Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You’ll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone’s after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
Birth of terror
Death of much more
I’m the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
Into ruin
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I’ll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression
Myself is after me

When a man lies he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what’s wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Every thought I’d think you’d disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired
Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
I’m living blindly
Time has frozen still what’s left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it’s life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
You’ve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I’ve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I’ve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do
I’m in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me
Hidden in your world you’ve made for me
I’m seething
I’m bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew

Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head
Grain of sand

I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines that set my hand
Say go, go, go
Beware of a place
A smile of a bright shining face
I'll never return, how do you know?
Tarot woman
I don't know
She can take you there
The entrance to the fair
Mine, mine, mine
Ride the carousel
And cast a magic spell
You can fly, fly
Tarot woman, well I don't know
Something in the air
Tells me to beware, no, no, no
Her love is like a knife
She'll carve away your life
So go, go, go
Tarot woman, I don't know
Hey, I don't know

In the light of the day
You can hear the old ones say
Was the sound last night the wind?
Can you feel the change begin?
By the fall of the snow
A single soul will go
The footsteps on the white
There's an unholy light
There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go
To run with the wolf
When the world makes a turn
The eyes of one will learn
That a sound just like the wind
Only makes the change begin
By the end of the rain
The feelings passed again
From things that snap and bite
An unholy light
There's a break in the ground
Like the swirling water's angry as they pull you down
When the siren calls you go, yeah
Run with the wolf
Something evil is passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go, yeah
Like a beast in a field
He knows his fate is sealed
He runs with the wolf, oh oooh
See the break, you know it's the same(?)
Now he goes
To run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run
Now we go run, run, run, run
All right

If I'm high on a hill
She'd still been looking down at me
What does she see that brings her closer every day to my heart
If I'm away from home
And think I'm all alone
She's there, somewhere
I look around to see
And looking back at me
She's there, beware!
Creeping like a hungry cat
Seen it before
I know it can mean that
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck
The lady starstruck, running after me
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah
I could fly to the moon
But she'd soon find a way to be there
I never knew for a while that a smile made 'em really care
She wants a souvenir
To everyone it's clear
She's hooked - with one look
She wants a photograph
And everybody laughs but not me 'cause I see
She's creeping like a hungry cat
I've seen it before
I know I can mean that
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, oh oh o-o-oh
Oh my
The lady starstruck, running after me, yeah
It used to be a game
Now I can't repeat my name at all
She seems to believe that
I never can refuse a call
She's hooked! With one look!
And everybody laughs, hah!
But not me 'cause I see
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, bad luck
The lady starstruck running after me
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
And back of a tree, looking back at me
Climbing up my stair
I've just got to beware
Lady starstruck, yes, she's bad luck, bad luck

Oh na na na na
Mystery to me is something I can't see
But I see you very well
You're slinky, cool, nobody's fool
But there's something inside I can tell
I know a poor man, a rich man
I know I can talk to a king
But nobody here is gonna tell me
I can't find out one thing
I see a glow around you
Open your arms 'cause I'm walking to you, coming straight or through
Maybe I'm wrong but I know it won't take long to see
Do you close your eyes
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah, yeah
Making sweet love to me, yeah
The logical trend has said I'll know in the end
The things that make you smile
So right from the start, I take an aim at your heart
and know that all the while
I know a rich man, a poor man
I know I can talk to a king, yeah
So nobody here is gonna make me believe
Open your arms 'cause I'm coming, running, straight on through
I could be wrong but I know it won't take long to see
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah
Do you close your eyes, I've gotta know
Do you close your eyes when you making love

High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?
Oh I see his face!
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?
Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky
Hey, I believe, I believe
Too many died
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go
All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand
Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed
In heat and rain
With the whips and chains
We built a tower of stone
But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many died
Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look,
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Time is standing still
He gave back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
The place I've known
But it's not home
Ooh
Take me back
He gave me back my will
Take me back, take me back
Back to my home ooh, ooh, ooh

Can't forget his face
What a lonely place
Has he really let us go?
All the time that's lost
What's the final cost
Will I really get away?
All my life it seems
Just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star
Can't believe it all
Did he really fall
What to do now I don't know
Something's called me back
There's a light in the black
Am I ready to go?
I'm coming home
Breathed the air before
Heard the thunder roar
Never knew it was for me
Always looking down
Lost and never found
Eyes that look but not to see
Like an open door
That you've passed before
But you've never had the key
Something's calling me back
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, yeah
I'm going back to my home
I'm going home, home, home
Going home, home, home
I'm coming back
Don't forget his face
Did he really let us go
What to do now, well I don't know
Like a light in the black
Yes, I'm ready to go
I'm coming home, home, yeah
I've got my way back home
To the sky
There in the sky
I see your starTwo worlds collide
Rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope
Against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up
Against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West
Or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart
In the warrior's code
There's no surrender
Though his body says stop
His spirit cries, never
Deep in our soul
A quiet ember
Knows it's you against you
It's the paradox
That drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
An unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire
In the burning heart

Silent darkness creeps into your soul
And removes the light of self-control
The cave that holds you captive has no doors
Burnin' with determination
To even up the score
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's rising high
The moment of truth draws near
Time will not allow you to stand still, no
Silence breaks the heart and bends the will
And things that give deep passions are your sword
Rules and regulations have no meaning anymore
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's rising high
The moment of truth is here
Is here
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's rising high
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within
Hearts on fire
Fever's rising high
Hearts on fire
Strong desire
Rages deep within

Rising up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times it happens too fast
You change your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
Face to face, out in the heat
Hanging tough, staying hungry
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street
For the kill with the skill to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
Rising up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop
Just a man and his will to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger

We're not indestructible
Baby, better get that straight
I think it's unbelievable
How you give into the hands of fate
Some things are worth fighting for
Some feelings never die
I'm not askin' for another chance
I just wanna know why
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in can't be wrong
I don't wanna pacify you
I don't wanna drag you down
But I'm feelin' like a prisoner
Like a stranger in a no named town
I see all the angry faces
Afraid that could be you and me
Talkin' about what might have been
I'm thinkin' about what it used to be
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in can't be wrong
Baby, baby, we can shed this skin
We can know how we feel inside
Instead of goin' down an endless road
Not knowin' if we're dead or alive
Some things are worth fightin' for
Some feelings never die
I'm not askin' for another chance
I just wanna know why
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home
There's no easy way out
Givin' in, givin' in can't be wrong, no
There's no easy way out
There's no shortcut home

would never change your mind
I'm sure you don't know but to me you seem so unkind
I don't [Incomprehensible] sympathy
I just want a chance to get you closer to me
I feel I'm on a, one way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
Surrender by voices, I don't want to hear
I tell myself that must be insincere
I never told you lies
He was the one who put the tears in you eyes
I feel I'm on a, one way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
Spend your whole life waiting for a sign
You make your move too late and love gets left behind
Truth is never, you don't want to see
I may falling, take advantage of me, take it from me
I don't care who is right or who is wrong
One day our loneliness is a day too long
You only may wanna stay
Second time 'round our heart is harder to brake, harder to break
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection
One way street
Moving in the wrong direction
It's a, one way street
Someone on my line, never gotta a bad connection

Deepest cut that can be healed
By the gun or by the sword
It's hope that you can turn yourself
Outside at the end of the war
The cold sweat sticks to your heart
Your mouth gets drier and drier
The battle inside rages on
Your pulse races higher and higher
Sweetest victory, I love you more than life itself
Sweetest victory, you give me strength to know myself
Oh, sweet victory, my soul is yours and the glory is mine
Sweetest victory, the far-off stars will always shine
The toothlike nails rip me up
I can make it disappear
Time to forget has passed me by
There's no place to hide my fear
Hate and pain filled me up
Every minute takes longer and longer
I bead of sweat 'cause drops of blood
Make me stronger and stronger
Sweetest victory, I love you more than life itself
Sweetest victory, you give me strength to know myself
Oh, sweet victory, my soul is yours and the glory is mine
Sweetest victory, the far-off stars will always shine
The cold sweat sticks to your heart
Your mouth gets drier and drier
The battle inside rages on
Your pulse races higher and higher
I love you more than life itself
You give me strength to know myself
Sweetest victory
Sweetest victory
Sweetest victory, I love you more than life itself
Sweetest victory, you give me strength to know myself
Oh, sweet victory, my soul is yours and the glory is mine
Sweetest victory, the far-off stars will always shine
Sweetest victory, Sweetest victory, Sweetest victory, Sweetest victory

U.S. prime, grade A stamped guaranteed 
Just grease it up and bring on the heat 
Throw it down and roll it over once or twice 
Then chow down 
[Chorus]
She's good enough, good enough to huh! 
I can't get enough, I can't get enough 
She's good enough to huh! 
Hey me yea I been working up an appetite 
Seems like the harder I work the more my body needs 
I like to open up with a little six on the half shell 
Then it's 3-6-9 times 
Hey waitress you got any specials here tonight 
Me and the fellas might be interested in 
Rack a what 
Well I'll have some of that 
I'll be the first to say that I'm blind to the world 
Cause I'm two days gone and I just can't see 
But I ain't no fool and honey I know a good thing 
And she's comin' she's comin' 
So come on, come on, come on cause she's 
Good, good, good enough 
Good, good, good enough ohhh!

Oh here it comes again 
That funny feelin again winding me up inside 
Every time we touch 
Hey I don't know 
Just tell me where to begin cause I never ever 
Felt so much 
[Chorus 1:]
No I can't recall any love at all 
Baby this blows 'em all away 
[Chorus 2:]
It's got what it takes 
So tell me why can't this be love 
Straight from my heart oh tell me why 
Can't this be love 
I tell myself 
Hey only fools rush in an only time will tell 
If we stand the test of time 
All I know 
You've got to run to win an I'll be damned if 
I'll get hung up on the line 
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Solo]
Tell me why can't this be love 
Baby why can't this be love 
Got to know why can't this be love 
I wanna know why can't this be love

[Chorus 1:]
Feel like throwing in the towel don't be a fool 
They're out to knock you out, put you down 
For the count 
Watch the left, watch the right, below 
The belt 
They'll run you round and round it's plain to see 
It's never gonna stop they'll run ya till you drop 
There ain't no power around can keep a good man down 
[Chorus 2:]
There's still some fight in me 
That's how it'll always be 
Hold your head up high, look 'em in the eye, never say die 
Get up and make it work 
You say that love has got you down well that's bull 
If love has got you down then love can pick you right back up 
Walking down a dead end street 
No mercy at your feet 
They're holding all the cards, making things so hard, before it goes too far 
Get up and make it work
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

World turns black and white
Pictures in an empty room
Your love starts fallin' down
Better change your tune
You reach for the golden ring
Reach for the sky
Baby just spread your wings
We'll get higher and higher straight up we'll climb
We'll get higher and higher leave it all behind
Run, run, run, away
Like a train runnin' off the track
The truth gets left behind
And falls between the cracks
Standing on broken dreams
But never losing sight
But you spread your wings
So baby dry your eyes, save all the tears you've cried
Ohh that's what dreams are made of
Oh baby we belong in a world that must be strong
[Solo]
Higher and higher leave it all behind
Oh, we'll get higher and higher who knows what we'll find
Ohh, that's what dreams are made of
Ohh, baby we belong in a world that must be strong
And in the end on dreams we will depend
Cause thats what love is made of

Ain't no way I'm stayin' home tonight 
I'll be out until the mornin' light 
Just hangin' 'round the local parking lot 
Checkin' out the girls see what they got 
Yea they love it when me and the boys 
Start playin' love with them human toys 
Yea we just wind 'em up and let 'em go, oh yea 
[Chorus:]
Summer nights and my radio 
That's all we need baby don't cha know 
We celebrate when the the gang's all here 
Hot summer nights that's my time of the year 
We made it through the cold 
This freezin' snow is gettin' really old 
Next year I'll head out for the coast 
Say boys I think that might just call for a toast, yea 
I got a line, you got a pole 
I'll meet you down at the ole fishing hole 
Yea them girls are biting good tonight 
Oh yea, uh oh, oh yea 
[Chorus]

I don't know what I been livin' on but it's 
Not enough to fill me up 
I need more than just words can say 
I need everything this life can give me 
Come on baby close your eyes let go 
This can be everything we've dreamed 
It's not work, that makes it work no 
Let the magic do the work for you 
[Chorus 1:]
Cause something heached out and touched me 
Now I see that all I want... 
[Chorus 2:]
I want the best of both worlds 
And baby I know what it's worth 
We can have have the best of both worlds a little 
Heaven right here on earth
There's a picture in the gallery of a 
Fallen angel looked alot like you 
We forget where we come from sometimes 
I had a dream it was really you 
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Solo]
You don't have to die to go to heaven 
Or hang around to be born again 
Just tune into what this place has got to offer 
Cause we may never be here again 

Contact
Is all it takes
To change your life
To lose your place in time
Contact!
Asleep or awake
Coming around
You may wake up to find
Questions deep within your eyes
Now more than ever you realize
And then you sense a change
Nothing feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in
Some kind of alien
Reach for the opening
Then simply pulls a string
Another world
Some other time
You lay your sanity
On the line
Familiar faces
Familiar sights
Reach back
Remember with all your might
Ooh there she stands in a silken gown
Silver lights shining down
Sleep and dream that's all I crave
I travel far across the Milky Way
To my master I become a slave
'Til we meet again some other day
Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before
Baby, pull the string

The love line is never straight and narrow
Unless your love is tried and true
We take our chance with new beginnings
Still we try, win or lose
Take the highs with the blues 
Always one more, you're never satisfied 
Instead of 'one for all' with you, it's only 'one for me'
Oh, when I draw the line and meet you half the way 
And you don't know what that means 
I feel like a running politician
Just trying to please you all the time
I'm giving you my share with no condition
Going wide, running long
Feeling lost but not for long 
So I draw the line and meet you half the way 
When you don't know what that means 
Always one more, you're never satisfied
So I draw the line and meet you half the way
When you don't know what that means
I'll meet you half the way! 
I'll meet you half the way

It's not what you are 
It's how you dress 
That's one thing I've learned from the guys 
I must confess 
Now me, look, I got this job not just beeing myself 
Huh uhh 
I went out and bought some brand new shoes 
Now I walk like someone else 
Maybe I'm crazy or just too high 
But all this can't be worth my 
Piece of the pie 
Sittin 'round just gettin' high 
Temporarily pacified 
I guess less is more 
Something special, something new 
Some brand new group to sink my teeth into 
Sittin 'round just getting high 
[Chorus:]
That's what's going down on the inside 
Don't let this get around to the outside 
This ain't no party, this ain't no show! 
So don't be tryin' to putt no mo jo on my butt, anyway 
[Solo]
[Chorus x4]Now your ships are burned
And the evil has returned
It will creep upon you
There's nothing to do
It will rip up your mind
And death you will find
Life is just a game
And death is just the same
Within the blood stained walls
In the center of your brain
Demons without mercy
Driving you insane
When the Orders are obeyed
And you have been slayed
You're lying on the ground
Without making a sound
As your soul fades away
You can hear someone say:
Ring the dooms day bell,
Turn the world into hell!

There's a hole in the sky
But don't ask me why
Because I don't know
There is a long way to go
Future will show
Where the road is leading me
I will never die
'Cause I will fly
To the other side
I'm trying to fight
For what is right
But evil spirits pass me by
They do what they want
They just don't care
What you feel or what you say
Where the road is leading us

No... No!
I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars
Who's to run and who's to fight?
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die
Who's to lose and who's to win?
I'll see the light tonight
Flashing through the sky
Take my life tonight!
Now the chaos has begun, people crying out
You're all alone, you gotta run!
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide
No we never had a chance!
No... Oh Oh Oh Oh!
Take my life tonight

You say the end of time is coming far too near
My love for life is torn in vain through all the years
What's the answer to the question
that we have been searching for
Can you tell?
Don't wanna fall apart before we have a chance
to try again
Don't let it end...
I tried so hard to make it right for you and I
Your sacred promises have all become a lie
Is this your idea of destiny?
'Cause if it is, just set me free
You can not fool me with your stories being told
My God it brings me down, I feel I'm growing old
No, please don't end it now, there is so much more
We can do, you know...don't let it end...
Let's gather what we had and build it up, again
It used to be so good, oh, please don't let it end

In the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall openIn the darkness, they will gather
Conjuring the one
Burning candles, incantations
Human sacrifice
Getting drunk from blood, not wine
Pointy daggers shine
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone
The dreaded one will rise
Rise...Burn...Rise...
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell
No one can stop what's already begun
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son
Victims of the grand illusion
Screams of ecstasy
Fools are lost in mass confusion
Searching for the key
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness
See the truth of the power within the beast
And when the time has come
The gates of hell shall open

Oh Yeah!
I am a Viking I’m going out to war
I've got death upon my mind
As I was leavin' oh yesterday
I've got no fear in my heart
As the shores of my home disappear
I sail over the sea without fear
Dragon ships are charging through the waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah!
I am a warrior my mind is set to kill
Life or death is on the line
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel
I've got your life right in my hand
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah yeah! yeah!
You are a loser and it's such a shame
That you're a fool and you don't know
That I’m a Viking I'll walk all over you
And by my sword you will die
Dragon ships are charging through those waves
Just want to sail away, far away into the sea yeah…yeah!
No No No… No!

No more will I do all the things that I've done
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind
She'd an iron tear, I'm trying to find
His soul had wandered through years of despair
Eyes without expression told to beware
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high
To find they're forgotten to rest and to die

Outcast, not knowing right from wrong
Surrounded by women, wine, and song
Never still always on the run
Prince of the night, killing with a gun
Now, he's taken a life away
Nowhere to run, nowhere to stay
Renegade, he fled from town to town
Vigilantes joint to hunt him down
For his head, lies a might price
He's a wanted man, dead or alive
Where will he go from here
He's on the run again...nowhere...no, no...
He's got mixed emotions running through his head
With a crazy notion, he's gonna end up dead
He's on the run, again
Tell me when will it end

Now the battle is over, the clouds're hanging low
Dead bodies lie on the ground
Marched into slaughter, lost souls fought in vain
No glory or pride to be found
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around
Trying to find my way home
Fighting for honour and medals of gold
But, they were to kill or be killed
Slaying the enemy, not knowing why
Keep low and fire at will
Lost out in action, long gone forever
Just a boy that died in vain
His mother is crying, his father not proud
Twisted gray faces in the rain
Trying to find my way home...

Just an ordinary day, all around it seems O.K.
With a normal view
Then you open up your eyes, suddenly you realize
Everyone's confused
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be
Everyone around is sad, but, they analyze you mad
Sayin' you've lost your mind
Seems their lives have been abused
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find
Seems the whole society in the world's insanity

It was you, it was me,
And we would last forever.
Any fool could see, that we were 
Meant to be
Without you, there is no meaning to
My life.
You're gone and it cuts me like
A knife.
How could you leave me?
You don't remember, I'll never forget
You just don't remember, I'll never forget.
Why did you turn away,
Let your love fade away and die.
You became so cold, you made me feel
So old.
When you left, you broke my heart
And just to see.
How many pieces there would be,
After you leave me.
You just don't remember, I'll never forget

You came to me
You said you were my friend
I shared my art and my mind.
You found it easier
To steal than create.
Then call it your's, though it's mine
You can't fight, what is right
Face the truth, liar
You can't feel, you just steal
You smile in my face,
When I turn around,
You stick a knife in my back.
You think you're clever,
You know you're insane,
You're lies are not white they are black.

They all were there, the court was full
The king beside his queen
His love was cold, the fool will dance
for her 'till end of time,
The queen is in love,
The queen is in love.
She couldn't help her burning heart,
And now he's burning too.
Their love was blind,
They will dance until the end of time.
Queen is in love
The furious king now has learned
He sentenced them to burn.
Forever one,
They are joined in death eternally

I now will tell you all a story,
That no one ever heard before.
It is the tale about the fury,
Remember wisdom is your strength.
It said you're such a fool
Just let my evil rule
No, it's burning like a flame,
Now nothing seems the same.
I've lost control of mind and body
My soul is in its hand
It's wish is my command.
Enslaved forever by the fury,
By the fury, no!
At first it came to me in visions,
And that was filling me with pain
And when my fear became desire,
To let the demon burn my soul.
It said "Don't fight in vain,"
"I'll make you love the pain."
I now have told you all my story
And still for you its not too late.
Don't draw your sword
Just use your wisdom
And never let this be your fate.
Oh, no it's here again,
This demon loves the pain.

Born with the fire in my blood,
Can't live without it.
Something that gold can never buy.
It doesn't matter who you are,
Or what your thinking,
If you believe in what you try.
Feel the fire,
Your burning desire.
Fire, I'm burning up with fire
Fire, feel it burning higher
If you are rich, or if you are poor,
There is no difference,
It's still in what you're fighting for.
If you are strong you will survive,
You'll feel the fire,
Burning on forever more.
Feel the fire
Your burning desire
Fire, I'm burning up with desire
You never play with fire.

Everyone is searching for the
Meaning of our life.
Reading 'bout the hell and heaven
Believing all those lies.
Look upon yourself
Imagine you are two
Power lies within this is true.
Can't you see its clear like a mirror
It's all within what you're searching for
Magic mirror, magic mirror
Now your eyes are open,
and you know you were a fool.
You always had the power,
But you never broke the rules.
Power lies within this is true
Magic mirror, Magic mirror
Once again I say,
The strength that we are all searching for,
High and low we all looked in vain
Can't you see, it's clear like a mirror.
It's all within what you're searching for.

In the time, when darkness ruled
No one saw the light
In the cold black emptiness
Victims of the night
You can't fight what you can't see
To be or not to be
In the dark ages
Those evil days will still remain,
Till someone breaks the chains.
Just the strong survive,
You have to try, or you will die.
In the Dark ages

Out of the darkness, the voices are calling
Riding the wings of a song
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling
I feel it coming on strong
The lightning, strikes cracking the night
It feels like never before
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark
I hear a rising force
Searching my soul, now I find something else
I take my life in my hands
Through the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell
The power is at my command
The lightning strikes, cracking the night
I'm not the same anymore
I feel a rising force
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire
The rising force starts to shine
A burning inferno, it soars ever higher
Leaving the demons behind

Look at me, see the love that you're missing
Can't you see that I'll always be there
You can't run you can't hide from the feeling tonight
Damage done. I guess love isn't fair.
Sometimes I wonder who you are
So close, but we've gone too far.
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby
You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl.
Lonely days, fill my nights with such sorrow
Shades of grey, turn into blue tomorrows.
Sometimes I wonder where you are
So close, but your eyes are so far.
You're gone and I can't go on and now my heart cries for you girl.

Lost in a dream in the arms of the night
Two lonely prisoners of our own device
Don't let me go. Hold on together
You wanna know if love can be real
I wanna take everything I can steal
Love on the line, it's now or never.
Why can't the night last forever.
This could be Paradise
Holding you here by my side
If we just close our eyes
We'll be in Heaven tonight.
Run through the night down streets of desire
Burning my soul, my heart's on fire
Give up the fight, it's sweet surrender
With trembling hands we reach for it all
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall
I need you now, now more than ever.
This feels like Paradise
I see the world in our eyes
If we just hold on tight

Shades of night, fall upon my eyes
Lonely world fades away
Misty light, shadows start to rise
Lonely world fades away.
In my dreams your face is all I see
Through the night you share your love with me.
Dreaming visions of you
Feeling all the love I never knew.
Here we are on the crossroads of forever
Shining star lights the way.
Walk with me on the winds of time
Love's mystery is for us to find.
Until that day, until the day I find you
I won't rest, I won't let go
Somehow some way, I know I'll be beside you
To warm my heart and fill my soul.

Locked up in chains, backs to the wall
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call
Pushed from outside, thrown underground
Frozen in time we wait for the sound.
Oh, I feel something coming
Looks like a riot in the dungeon.
Trapped behind bars, prisoners of death
All hope is ours, we can't give up yet
Ready to fight to get what we need
Die on your feet or live on your knees.
Looks like a riot in the dungeon
You stand and die or start your running
'Cause there's a riot in the dungeon.
It's got to give, it's gonna break
Dying to live, our freedom's at stake
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood
We won't give in till they've had enough.

I always knew, somewhere in time
We'd meet again, we'd cross that line
Don't need to question, no reason why
The answer lies before your eyes.
Do you know who I am
Do you understand?
Deja vu, dreams come true
I see my soul inside of you
Deja vu, so many lives
Familiar spirits behind your eyes.
We cross between worlds through windows of light
With open arms we hold back the night
The crystal of power we hold in our hands
We go on forever and love is the plan.

We hold the secret to a dream
We keep it wrapped in chains
Locked inside a mystery.
We climb a stairway to the stars
Through doorways of the heart
Step inside, the magic starts.
Gaze into my crystal ball,
See what lies behind the wall
Can't you feel the wonder of it all.
You veil your eyes in fantasy
Time to pull the curtain back
Distant worlds, so much to see.
I wanna know you, come on let me show you the way
I really wanna hold you, reach out to these hands of fate
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

Hold on tight in the heat of the night
Baby there can be no escape
Feelings right, getting hard to fight
Baby how much more can I take.
Tell me that it's real, everything you feel
What am I supposed to do
Look into my eyes, touch me deep inside
Let me feel your love cut through.
Oh, now is the time
Feeling your heart so close to mine
Oh, I want your touch, need you so much
Now is the time for our love.
Drowning in the flames, in the sea of desire
Angel with the devil's eyes
Turn up the heat and we fall in the fire
Can't you feel the temperature rise.
Tell me that it's true, you can feel it too
Let me be your fantasy
Baby hold me tight, say that it's alright
You know you can count on me.
When the fire starts I can feel you burning tonight
With an open heart baby won't you let me inside,
Let me inside girl.

Step inside the dream machine
You're on a power drive
Feel the passion of the beast
Watch her come alive.
Oh, you're almost there, ride on silver air
You better hold on tight, she's fire in the night.
Faster than the speed of light
Hugging all the curves
Hang on to your life
Supercharged and flying low
She's liquid dynamite.
Got your hands upon the wheel
The pedal to the floor
Now it's time for nerves of steel
Hear the engine roar.
Oh, you shoot the thrill, heading for the kill
No control tonight, she's liquid dynamite.
Rev it to the Red line
You're tearing up the street
12 cylinders and she's all mine
She's too tough to beat
Oh, you shoot to thrill 
Heading for the kill
No control tonight
she's liquid dynamite

To be lonely is my only trust
In my silent movies 
I can expose my lust
Taking snapshots in the light
That I do recall when I retire
Playing with my fantasies I let the curtain fall
In my desire
Still I need that touch for real
To discover and to feel
You're the one that breaks my heart
And it's tearing me apart
Making love to you baby
Making love it's all I want
Making love
Every subway-every crowded street
Feeding my emotions
We pass but never meet
My touch is two dimensional
I slowly close my eyes and think of you
More or less invisible
Still you're my point of view
I can't get to you

Come on baby, what's on your mind
You're stumbling in the darkness
Like you're running blind
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
This same old graveyard
on the same playground
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round

Once we were one 
Now we're worlds apart
Deep inside you know you are my other heart
My memories seem like yesterday
Can't believe it's all so far away
All these years
All our tears
Still we sing the same old song
Let's make right all that went wrong
There's no beginning there's no end
There is no reason to pretend
Crying from help from above
We've got to save our love
You said to me
That we hold the key
Eternal love we give and take
It was meant to be
My love for you
Was always true

With your love you gave me life
Not knowing right from wrong
You always know that I'll be strong
You set me free and you paid the price
You inspired me in my art
With the rebel in your heart
You gave nothing for nothing
But the spirit of you word happiness could bring
I learned to always do the best I can
You taught me to be true and I never ran
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Left all alone in the cold
Nowhere to go so I run like the wild
Stumbling, falling
Crying calling you...
As they gave nothing in return
You became their slave although you were brave
You still teach me what is left to learn
Though they brought you to the grave
You will remain to ease my pain

Don't ever try to fool me
Cause I can see right through you
It's in your eyes
You are the devil in disguise
Hold me, feel me
Wound and heal me
Mend this broken heart
Though you're near me
You can't hear me
But you tear my soul apart
I can't beat you
Can't defeat you
You just make me cry inside
Don't even try to fool me
My rage is growing stronger
And I can't wait no longer
Never learning
Vengeance is burning
Deep inside your mind
Time will come to
When I'll make you
Stumbling like blind leading the blind

I cast my pearls before the swine
Sealed and delivered
Then I drink your toast of wine
Though it's bitter sweet
I'm eating from you hand so neat
Pennies from heaven
You say you give
You say you love
But yet you live 
Judas...Judas
Sightseeing through the lights
and shades of you mighty colonnades
No I got the picture
of the beauty and the beast
I am the lamb...you are the priest
To crucify me
To make a living...Makes no difference
Friends, you are what you do
Some are false and some are true
You haven't got a clue
I'd rather reign in hell some said
Than serve in heaven

I was carried to you
By the hands of my fate
Thought it was too late
I wasn't the type that believed in true love
At first sight
you changed it to the right
I know what I feel
This is real
I give you my body and soul
Let your resistance drop
Don't have to stop
By the siren's call
I cry I try tell me what do you want
I'm not the type to believe
in a second chance
Or in sweet romance
I'm no beginner been fooling around before
Still coming back for more
Today is different
It was meant
I've found a reason
There's more than one season
Time to think it over

My one way ride in dead end street
Leading to victory and glory
You seek I hide you'll find defeat
My future's in the hands of fury
You try - but never win
Can't you see I am the demon driver
Don't lie it is a sin
Cuz you know I am the demon driver
I live to drive and never wait
For guardian angels riding by me
To speed or die I'm never late
Wherever you are there will be

Something deep inside, far from reality
We pretend it never crossed our mind
we feel but never sense
Building up a strong defense
Some say it's our destiny, Lord...
We're living on the faultline
Get out of here
Cry the prophets of our time
Fear the signs
Save those you love and all your children
You life depends on castles in the sand
Don't look back there is no promised land
We don't want to hear that this could be the day
So much for science fiction
as you always say
But soon the day will come
It's only just begun
For the people on the faultline
it's no use to pray
Why living in danger
Why living in danger, danger

Can't bow for a rule
Cause I'm nobody's fool
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win
Sometimes I might be rude
Acting in my mood
I'm trying to be straight
Cause I don't want to be late
There's nothing you can say to make
me feel worse than I do (how are you)
You can't buy my freedom
Keep me locked in your cell
Sad how we waste our energy
When all our days are few (makes me blue)
We're two of a kind me and you
I guess that I'll see you in hell
Who is my friend
Who will remain
Seems like I always stand alone in the end
Nobody lasts until the end
You can't buy my life and freedom
It's more than just buy and sell
You can't keep me locked in your cell
See you in hell
