Are you feeling the fire, are you ready to explode?
Are your dreams and desires riding down an open road?
I'm like a runaway, a heart without a home
Others can laugh and play
I'll fight for every inch I take, I'm desperate to the bone
Stay hungry, feel the fire
Stay hungry, don't explode
Stay hungry, with desire
Stay hungry, you're alone
Be the hunter and the hunted, keep your target in your sight
Don't be side tracked or shunted, let pretenders feel your bite
And if you start to slide never show you're weak
Don't feel you've got to hide
Remember what you're fighting for, remember what you seek
Alright
If your fire is faded and you can't feel it no more
If you're tired and overrated, let me show you to the door
Expect no sympathy, there's none to be had
Open your eyes and see
There's no room for the wannabees, the has beens or the bad
...

We're not gonna take it
No, we ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it anymore
We've got the right to choose and there ain't no way we'll lose it
This is our life, this is our song
We'll fight the powers that be just, don't pick our destiny 'cause
You don't know us, you don't belong
Oh, you're so condescending, your gall is never ending
We don't want nothing, not a thing, from you
Your life is trite and jaded, boring and confiscated
If that's your best, your best won't do
We're right, yeah
We're free, yeah
We'll fight, yeah
You'll see, yeah
No way!
We're not gonna take it (no!)
We're not gonna take it anymore (just you try and make us)
We're not gonna take it (come on)
No, we ain't gonna take it (you're all worthless and weak)
We're not gonna take it anymore (now drop and give me twenty)
We're not gonna take it (a pledge pin)
No, we ain't gonna take it (on your uniform)

Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in child, take my hand
Here there's no work or play, only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say as you go down, down, down
You're gonna burn in hell
Oh, burn in hell
You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire, but I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn
Before I burn in hell
Take a good look in your heart, tell me what do you see
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late
And then you'll burn in hell
Hear no evil, don't you
See no evil, don't you (oh, burn in hell)
Lay no evil down on me (you're gonna burn in hell)
Speak no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you (oh, burn in hell)
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free
See no evil, don't you
Think no evil, don't you
Play with evil, 'cause I'm free (you're gonna burn in hell)
...

Oh, it's so nice to see you all inside my dreamy little world
And it's so nice to be with all you lovely little boys and girls
Make yourselves comfortable, my place is so divine
Don't you think I'm wonderful? Say yes! You're on my time
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Don't try to leave, the doors are locked and only I have got the key
Forget the windows, they're nailed shut and boarded up so you can't see
You'll love the light show, oh, I'm sure you'll think it's swell
When they go off, you're welcome to my living hell
Come here, my sweet
Let me help you with that
There, that's better
I'm overjoyed at all the games I'm playing here with you today
But I'm so sad the party's over and we can no longer play
You think you're going home to your own little bed
But that's impossible, you can't sleep when you're dead
...
It happened in the broad daylight
So unexpected came the knife
A child's scream sliced through the air
But no one came or seemed to care, no!
The man's description did little good
A local stranger from the neighborhood
Those little kids, oh, he left behind
With their mangled lives and their tortured minds
Since he didn't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair
Call for street justice
Let no mercy show
Don't let him go
The man was caught and brought before a judge
Who had just returned from a three drink lunch
His lawyer screamed "you must set him free"
And off he went on a technicality
Since the law don't seem to care, then don't you think it's only fair
Why should parents cry?
How many have to die?
The mob assembled, smoke filled the air
And marched in anger to do what's fair
To bring to justice this soulless thing
And show the others what evil brings
Now before you shake your head, think if it was your child instead
Tell me what you'd do
Pray this isn't true
When slime escapes the law
We'll even up the score
Please don't let him go...

I wanna rock! (rock)
I want to rock! (rock)
Turn it down you say
But all I got to say to you is time and time again I say, "no!"
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to when you tell me not to play I say, "no!"
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you
There's a feelin' that
I get from nothin' else and there ain't nothin' in the world that makes me go!
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
Turn the power up
I've waited for so long so I could hear my favorite song so, let's go!
When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me
There's nothin' else that I would rather do
Rock (rock)
I wanna rock!
...

How long I have wanted this dream to come true
And as it approaches, I can't believe I'm through
I've tried, oh, how I've tried
For a life, yes a life, I thought I knew
Oh, it's the price we gotta pay and all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose, though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done
Time seems to have frozen but the mind can be fooled
As the days pass I discover, destiny just can't be ruled
Hard times, oh, hard times
For the prize, yes the prize, I thought I knew
...

Look at you, you're my dream
Are you all that you seem?
Now you have what I need, and what I believe
Don't tell me you'll lose it, 'cause I'll have to leave
Don't let me down
What do I have to give
Until you let me live?
You're all that I work for but that's not enough
Do I have to die too to show you my stuff?
Well, I give you my best
So, why don't you understand?
I'm passing the biggest test
So, don't cry, lend a hand
Head held high, heart in hand
Flesh and blood, make a man
If that disappoints you, well, what can I say?
I don't want you to hurt, I just want to play
...

You can hear the thunder long before the storm
But you can't hear the lion when he stalks his prey
He's moving like a shadow, creeping up on you
And like a siren's call he's gonna have his way
You'd better run, forget your pride
Don't make a stand, just step aside
If you don't have what it takes, don't try to play, you'll lose your stakes
Remember this at least
It's the nature of the beast
You won't hear a footstep comin' up on you
Movin' like a snake he's in complete control
This killer knows his business, he is the predator
You are his only target, you're his only goal
What will you say, what will you do?
Your wildest nightmare's comin' true
There is nothing you can say, no way to change, he won't delay
This cain will have his feast
If you play you're bound to lose
Don't roll the dice, don't turn the screw
Just listen to the priest

Black sheep of the family, nothing like the rest
Separate from the others, failing all their tests
Can't they see you're different, so hungry and so lean
You're a walking wonder, you're a metal machine
Look and you'll see you're a lot like me
You're an S.M.F.
You're an S.-M.-F.
Caught up in their worries and tomorrow's dream
Missing all the living, milk without the cream
They think you're so foolish, living for today
Caring just what you think, not what others say
Join with us, oh, how they'll scream and fuss
We're the ones that live it, we're all really free
And if they think that we're sick then sick is what we'll be
Scream it loud, Know what you are, be proud

Gather 'round us, join with the band
Together we're stronger, together we'll stand
Say what can you do, well, we've got a plan
And we're gonna take you to the promised land
It's time to remember, it's time to move on
They've pushed it too far, they don't know what they've done
If it's a fight that they want then it's a fight that they'll get
We never lose, honey so place your bets
Long ago and far away
We had a voice, you know that we had a say
We won't live for yesterday
Ready or not, we're gonna have our way
We got the numbers, yeah, we got the might
We got the strenght and we got the right
We got the reason, yeah, we got the night
So wake up the sleeping giant
Not one more minute, not one more day
We've waited too long, can't let our chance slip away
We won't stop 'til we get it, we won't stop 'til we're done
We'll bite and we'll claw until they've lost and we've won
We took all we're gonna take
It's got to stop, you know there's too much at stake
Who the hell are they to say
What we can do and how we can play
Whoa
Wake up the sleeping giant
Let's push to the limit, so let's push 'til we're home
We've been good too long, they wouldn't leave us alone
It's our rights they're abusing, it's our right to fight back
So rally the troops and let's start the attack
We got the numbers, you know we got the might
We got the reason and we're ready to fight

Oh know, that girl, she's lookin' so fine
I know she knows ,what she's doin' to my mind
Ooh, does she know that I'm wanting her so
Well, there's one thing I know, I can never let her go
Talkin' 'bout hot love, you're making me crazy
Hot love, you're making me bad
Hot love, you're making me crazy
Think I'll go mad
So cool, no fool, she's headin' for me
Can't run, can't hide, she's in everything I see
Ooh, what will I say, should I pass, should I play
But my feet turn to clay 'cause she's blowin' me away
Think I'll go mad (think I'll go mad)
Talkin' 'bout my hot love
Think I'll go mad, ooh
Talkin' 'bout my hot love, ooh
Think I'll go mad, yeah

You saw me comin', you had my number
But you don't want me, could you be dumber
Your eyes are flashin', your lips are willing
But I'm a patsy for the killing
You're so beautiful, so unforgettable
You think that I'd do most anything
Love is for dreamers, love is for believers
Love is for losers, love
Is for suckers
Love is for suckers, love is for suckers
Listen, I'm not some poor fool, won't jump through your hoop
Ain't gonna crawl, girl, to that I won't stoop
So if you want me, you'll have to get me
And if you're willing I'll be ready
To me that just don't mean anything
Listen, well, well, well, if it isn't little miss perfect
And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?
You wanna get back together? You do, huh?
Well, listen honey, I'm just not interested
You'll what? You will? With your heels on?
Oh no, come on, babe, let's go
Here I go again
You know that I'll do most anything
Listen, love is for suckers, love is for suckers
Sucker fight me, sucker fight you (love is for suckers)
Always be suckers and do most anything
I wanna be a sucker (love is for suckers)
I'm a sucker, you're a sucker
He's a sucker, she's a sucker (love is for suckers)
Would you like to be a sucker, to be sucker?
Love is for suckers, yeah, yeah
Sucker

Ow, alright
Hey girl, across the room
Say I'm in love, babe, it's much too soon
But you know I'd give you everything that I have
Girl, do you know what you're doin' to me?
I'm gettin' burned in the first degree
I want your love, never needed somethin' so bad
Ooh, I need your love, oh, I want your love
All I got to have is your love
Ooh, can't get enough, oh, you're so damn tough
All I ever want, ever need is you
I'm so hot for you
Baby love me through and through
Make you love me like I do
Hard night, just watchin' you
Can't take the way that you do what you do
I got to have you, girl, you know you're driving me mad
Do you wanna play, yeah, you know what to say
Come on, girl, I'm ready, come on, girl, I'm ready
Tell me I can stay, yeah, don't you be that way
Come on, girl, now how can you be so cruel
You got me comin' right on cue
I'm so hot for you, yeah
I'm so hot for you, I want your love
I'm so hot for you, can't get enough

Tonight
Are you ready for a hard time, are you ready for the ball to top 'em all
Are you ready for the long ride, are you ready for the rise before a fall
Are you ready for the big game, are you ready for the coup de tat, et al
Are you ready for the long train, are you ready for the final curtain call
Well, we're gonna kill 'em, gonna stomp 'em tonight
Yeah, we're gonna thrill 'em, gonna do 'em up right
Oh, we're gonna take 'em, gonna give 'em a fright
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, we're gonna lose control
Tonight, tonight, we're gonna have you all
Tonight, tonight, you're gonna beg for more
Tonight, tonight
Did you come to see the bad boys, did you come to watch us shake, rattle and roll
Did you come to hear us make noise, did you come to see us put it in the hole
Do you know that it's the right time, do you know that it's the time to lose your mind
Do you know that it's not a crime if you're bending all the rules that you can find
Well, we're gonna break 'em, gonna make 'em tonight
Yeah, we're gonna push 'em, gonna go for the light
Oh, we're gonna stroke 'em, gonna do it all night
Did you come to see the bad boys

Wooh
Always livin' on the outside, never had no place to hide
Feelin' so alone
I got this thing dead to rights, ain't givin' in without a fight
How the years have flown
Me and the boys we never lost control
It's one for all, yeah, we take care of our own
Me and the boys just wanna rock, there's some things you never stop
We got it and we're never lettin' go, just me and the boys
Me and the boys
We make a big noise, we gotta roll
We don't got a choice, it's in our soul
Oh, me and the boys
With our backs against the wall, no way we're gonna fall
We won't go away
Another place, another show, another face, another no
I got somethin' to say
Me and the boys we know our destiny, just how it is and how it's gonna be
Me and the boys take what we need, get in our way, we'll make you bleed
To the victor go the spoil in our creed, just me and the boys
Me and the boys we never lost control, it's one for all, we take care of our own

Wow, alright
I'm not bad, I'm damn good
But I'll admit I don't do all I should
I don't kill, I don't steal
Well, maybe only when I need a meal
All I'm saying's true but there's one thing that I do
And I just can't explain it, there's no way to restrain it
If I quit the rest I still couldn't pass the test
Cause I could not give up this one last thing
I got one bad habit (one bad habit)
I like to rock 'n' roll
I'm not mean, I'm not rude
But just don't make me lose my patience, dude
I don't curse, well just a bit
Somehow "gee whiz" and "golly" don't make it
Still they say I'm bad from the preachers to my dad
Cause I can't give up this feelin', it's just so damn appealin'
If they have their way I won't last another day
No matter how I try I can't stop this thing
I like to rock 'n' roll!
And if they find one day that it eats your mind away
That won't change the way I'm feelin', don't need that kind of healin'
There's nothin' else I crave so I'd trade the life I'd save
For my rock 'n' roll, now come on and sing
Rock 'n' roll (one bad habit)
I gotta rock, I gotta rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll (one bad habit)
Ooh rock my soul, yeah (one bad habit)
Ooh na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na yeah (one bad habit)
I gotta rock, gotta do rock, gotta do rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll

Whoa, yeah
This is the night I waited for
Countin' the days, I couldn't take one more
I broke my back, you know I strained my brain, oh yeah
And now the more I give the less I seem to gain, oh no
Now I'm on my time, I do what I wanna do
It's my time to shine, this is it, I'm breakin' through, oh
I want this night to last forever, oh yeah
I want this night to last forever
Listen to me now
Out on the street the night fills my brain
So many girls to meet, they'll never be the same, ha
My radio's playin' my favorite tune, oh yeah
This is the life, nothin' I'd rather do, no no
I feel so alive, leave my troubles far behind
Gonna rock tonight, takin' every chance I find, no
Let's go
All 'round, 'round the town, up and down, hear the sound
All 'round, 'round the town, up and down, whoa
All 'round, 'round the town, hear the sound, whoa
Come on, let's stroll
I got to have it
I want this night to last forever, I need it, woman, let's do it baby
I want this night to last forever, come on, boys, let's go

When I think of all the years and all the things I never say
How you fought back all your tears and you've never tried to walk away
Well I've been all 'round the world and I've seen all kinds of girls
And there's one thing that I know for sure
That there's no one else like you who loves me the way you do
For what's ailin' me you got the cure
Oh babe, listen to me, please
You are all that I need
All I want is you
All I wanna do
If you turned away from me sayin' this is what you have to do
If you said that we can't be, girl I'd always be in love with you
And if I live a thousand times
I'd be guilty of the crime of eternal love and dedication
And if I only get one chance to know the meaning of romance
Well then I'm happy with my education
Baby, baby, baby, listen to me, please
Baby, baby, won't you listen to me, please
You are, you are all that I need
All I want is you, all I need is you
Ooh yeah, yeah, all that I want, all I need is you

Yeah right
We got you where we want you and we're never lettin' go
Yeah right, yeah right
We've trapped you in our web now, aren't you old enough to know
So stomp your hands and clap your feet, do a dance, hook into the beat
Yeah right, yeah right, we got you now
We've pulled you into our world and you'll never get away
You might as well give in' cause we're big and mean and here to stay
So jump and shout, shake and cry, wave your fist, rock until you die
So stomp your hands and stomp those feet
Do a dance, hook into the beat
