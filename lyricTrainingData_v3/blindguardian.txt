Now the time has come for me to leave this land
Take my charge with pride sacrifice
Running and hiding I'm left for the time
To bring back the order of divine
Hunted by goblins no Gandalf to help
With swords in the night
Oh the last part of the game
Decision of death and life
Blood for Sauron they'll call tonight
The final battle cry
There exist no tales and hobbits are crying for all
Children of death
I have a dream the things you've to hide for
Deliver our kingdom and our Reich
Don't fall in panic just give me the thing
That I need or I kill
Don't run away for what have I done
Oh majesty your kingdom is lost
And you'll leave us behind
And ruins remind of your time
Now come back
Run, run, run
Cries Cries in a dark land
Hear the voice it's cold as ice
Eyes they are watching
They look for me but cannot find
Creature is following no place to escape
My last steps will find the right way
Where's the future the call of the blind
Cause there is none to find
Watch the sky you see no light
My weapons burst with fear
With the howling wolves the nazgul will die
For all Children of death
Run Run for the whole world
It's time you cannot wait
Lost Lost in a dark world
You feel the strange but cannot see
Too many battles we carry along from the war
And too many frightens we feel from his law
For so many victories we're praising so strong
For so many blood we've lost
Run, run

Extermination thunder the strange one is back again
Lost by our only power it's aura will grind us out forever
Fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
We're watching our own agony many years ago
Seven little children stand against the ghost
Believing is the answer but you've lost before
Find back to your infancy it's time to die
I've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
I find taste on lampskin everything's allright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
I give them illusions to raise their fear
Hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
Feel the sweetness of it's death everything's allright
But there's a new feeling I've never known
There must be a third one a mighty guardian
Guardian, Guardian, Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse of heaven
Now it feel the curse of the child
Dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it again
Fear our returning visions to madness we'll fall
if we can't kill the beast forever we must die now
One has blown his life away
Once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
Our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
By the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
We'll find the answer it's time to die
By a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
little Billy you must find your way
Believe in you we ask for but where
we can never find
there must be a sign for the
Guardian of the Blind
Now it feel the curse
Come to it's world following the sign
Give us the help we're waiting for your sign

Years ago I came back
this has been my hardest attack
A burning fire's in my brain
I could feel the deadly flame
Tales of the magic in my head
to a dark dream I fall in my mind
I hold the key of fortune
To feel the strange thing's in my mind
the stone of Ambar I must find
I'll take the chance that day
Halloween - The wizards crown I'll take on
Halloween
Halloween - But there is no return on Halloween
I'm the servant of the Blind to cross the
realms of death
the gate is open wide you cannot close
His dungeons deep no place to hide
The times have changed he has to fight
In magic spell I fall
Illusions falling in my mind
But where's the key I cannot find
the ritual has begun
The battle has begun
the warlocks time has come
I pay the price I've to pay
Why haven't see the signs
I'm loosing now my life
but cannot die forever life

There comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creature will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless - Oh no
I see the hill but it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
Run for the Night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and blooddlust their weapons and madness
you see their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
who the mightiest of all will now
You see them running in the shadows of the night
It is not what it used to be
they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you them running with the wind they
run for the night [3x]

He was born in the past time
To take all our pain
The kingdom of heaven's near
The children of this time
Must die for his arrive
To let all the legends be true
The prophecy said they'll call king of the Jews
He is born now to take all our sins
Three kings were searching for this holy child
The journey begins, he has to die
Healing the cripples and taking our pain
He came for the sinner
But what we've said
Disciples are following
They are calling his words
Salt of the earth and light of the world
Martyr - we are following you
Bless us for eternity
Messiah - we are torturing you
When you lose the power of your words
Jump from the temple and angle will save
Show me that you are the son of our God
Now take my land with my power you get
Rulin' the world of tomorrow
Messiah liar our burning desire
He is the king without a crown
We'll set him to his throne
Give me 30 p of silver and I'll be your man
Higher liar the fallen Messiah
Let us see his agony
The things he done are blasphemy
Mob has lost their joy on toy
So let us kill him fast
Now drink my blood for the new testament
This is my body you eat
One of you twelve is the one who betrays
Better that he's never born
Judas you're the chosen one
The world has damned your name
Begin with a kiss
At a cross it will end
The kingdom of heaven we've passed
The sky will turn black and the curtain will fall
The father's crying for his son
The tortured Messiah is finding his way
The journey has come to the end
The twelve ones are preaching the words he'd left
They're changing the way of the world but die for
No

Can't believe the things I see
That happens in the state
By a mortal distance that I can't believe
Self destructive infernal
To save us from the breed
But I know that it is all a lie
Star wars begin now
His bombs come exploding
To bring back the death of the night
No mercy he's knowing
How strong he must show us
For the last film you all get a part
Be by my side
Or you've to die
Believe what I do is the right
Soon Armageddon
Last hours are running now
The final solution begins
The words of a madman
No children to tell them
For what they'll not see in the light
Choose by your voice
He kills and destroys
At the end you must die for the night
In earlier chess games
We're playing the part of a soldier
But now we are not qualified
To save our own life
The traps are all placed by command
They are ready to strike
We live and we'll die
By the lies to believe
Try to escape from this suicide dreams
Or past time will come back again
Hiroshima is a joke to that what will come
At the end of the game we all die
Die now
Battalions of fear
They search and they scream
For the American dreams
The way of R.R.
To show he is the star
Battalions
Star wars
With hands full of blood
He talks about peace
With snake poisoning tongue
He's praying
El Salvador and Vietnam
You soon fast forget
But you satisfy on Afghanistan
You've been the master
You kill with a laughter
Your screams of peace are wrong and loud
Cause so we are and here we are
We scream and shout!
Your laughing about all the fools
Scream and shout!
With power of evil they stand

No sign of life did flicker
In floods of tears she cried
"All hope's lost it can't be undone
They're wasted and gone"
"Save me your speeches
I know (They blinded us all)
What you want
You will take it away from me
Take it and I know for sure
The light she once brought in
Is gone forevermore"
Like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"(We're) lost in the deep shades
The misty cloud brought
(A wailing when beauty was gone
Come take a look at the sky)
Monstrous it covered the shore
Fearful into the unknown"
Quietly it crept in new horror
Insanity reigned
And spilled the first blood
When the old king was slain
Nightfall
Quietly crept in and changed us all
Immortal land lies down in agony
"How long shall we
Mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
Will not return
Say farewell to sadness and grief
Though long and hard the road may be"
But even in silence I heard the words
"An oath we shall swear
By the name of the one
Until the world's end
It can't be broken"
Just wondering how
I can still hear these voices inside
The doom of the Noldor drew near
The words of a banished king
"I swear revenge"
Filled with anger aflamed our hearts
Full of hate full of pride
We screamed for revenge
"Vala he is that's what you said
Then your oath's been sworn in vain
(But) freely you came and
You freely shall depart
(So) never trust the northern winds
Never turn your back on friends"
"Oh I'm heir of the high lord!"
"You better don't trust him"
The enemy of mine
Isn't he of your kind and
Finally you may follow me
Farewell
He said
Back to where it all began

Far, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain
It lies unknown
The land of mine
A hidden gate
To save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence
Words of wisdom
I've seen the end of all
Be aware the storm gets closer
Mirror Mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind can't you see
That the winds will change
That tomorrows bears insanity
Gone's the wisdom
Of a thousand years
A world in fire and chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far
Deep down it lies my secret vision
I better keep it safe
Shall I leave my friends alone
Hidden in my twilight hall
(I) know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames
Alone
How shall we leave the lost road
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Even though
The storm calmed down
The bitter end
Is just a matter of time
Shall we dare the dragon
Merciless he's poisoning our hearts
Our hearts

Light fails at dawn
The moon is gone
And deadly the night reigns
Deceit
Finally I've found myself
In these lands
Horror and madness I've seen here
For what I became a king of the lost?
Barren and lifeless the land lies
Lord of all Noldor
A star in the night
And a bearer of hope
He rides into his glorious battle alone
Farewell to the valiant warlord
The Fate of us all
Lies deep in the dark
When time stands still at the iron hill
I stand alone
Noone's by my side
I'll dare you
Come out
You coward
Now it's me or you
He gleams like a star
And the sound of his horn's
Like a raging storm
Proudly the high lord
Challenges the doom
Lord of slaves he cries
Slowly in fear
The dark lord appears
Welcome to my lands
You shall be damned
The iron crowned
Is getting closer
Swings his hammer
Down on him
Like a thunderstorm
He's crushing
Down the Noldor's
Proudest king
Under my foot
So hopeless it seems
You've troubled my day
Now feel the pain
The Elvenking's broken
He stumbles and falls
The most proud and most valiant
His spirit survives
Praise our king

I feel cold
Facing the darkness
The light's gone away
Deep in his castle he said
All land'll be mine
There's one thing for sure
The triumph of shadow is near
Deep in his castle they sang
We shall not rest
Until all will be thyne
All land is mine
You can be sure
Don't dare me
the mighty one screamed
Smashed down the light
I will not rest till I'm king
Valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
Rise of Fall
a dark tale ends
just wondering how
in the darkness
they found their way
to the right place
children of the sun
second kindred
we call their race
treat them kindly
born in the east
(are the) nightfearer
they moved westwards
towards the sunshine
(they are) morning breath like
short's their life
(like) dawn passes by
when the day comes
the field was lost
(and) hope had passed away
the sun went down
beyond the sea
dark was the hour
but day shall come again
Clean my wounds
wash away all fear
let courage be mine
noone hears me crying
no song no tale
which contains all the grief
(but)
renowned the deeds
and the victims of defeat
sit down on your chair
and look out for your kin
with my eyes you'll see
and with my ears you'll hear
you troubled my day
and you've questioned my strength
(but) don't mess
with the master of fate
I smashed down the light
and dared Valinor
revenge will be mine
Slowly marching on
still we're marching on

I've seen the moon
And the first sunrise
I'll leave it to the memories
And kiss the wind goodbye
For the Eldar
I'm trapped inside this dream
Of the Eldar's
Song of doom
I've tasted poison
When I drank the wine of fate
But the fear was in my heart
I realized too late
The house of spirits call
Song of the doom
High's the fee
Soon my spirit will return
Welcome dawn
Your light will take me home
I say farewell
To the Eldar

It cannot be seen but there's blood on the green
Only God knows I'm innocent
Take me, take me home
A dark seed reigns in me like the Storm rules over the sea
I challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
Don't dare me now
The threatening shadows will pass by
They're getting closer now
Open your eyes
Wake up my dear young friend
And hate shall fade away
I will not move, yet
I'll stand still instead
There on the battlefield he stands
Down on the battlefield he's lost
And on the battlefield it ends
War and anger shall reign
The clash of iron can be heard
By blindness you're driven insane
I'm lost in anguish and grief
Sorrow won't wane 'til you die
A shattered body deeply hurt
And darkness will cover the light
It's gone forevermore
The field's been left in sorrow
The father and the son they're gone
The Sun shines bright and anger rises
Lorn and lonely torn apart
Don't you think it's time to stop now
We were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
Let's pray that heaven is on our side
Through violence and horror shall honour arise
So let's pray and blessed shall be our leader
We follow the noble and bright
Don't you hear me crying, crying
Come take me away
I hallow thy name
That's what the minstrel sing
Join in the horrible screams
Take part in murderous deeds
Renowned be the lion-hearted
Join in the minstrelsy
Wailing in endless grief
It eagerly longs for more
Broken bodies lay down on the ground
Blood sheds all over the place
The green will be stained forever
And hate reigns all over the field
They keep struggling on in anger
Fiercely intense outrageous, too blind to see
And in pain they keep on singing
We claim the land for the highlord
God bless the land and our highlord

Run
'Til you find the answer
Time out
For our poor Cassandra
She's fairly safe inside the fire
Inside the fire
Awakes desire
Cruelly admired
They'll torture her soul
And they'll torment her heart
But won't change her mind
Would you like to see me
How I'll cut off
Her head life's a game
A lesson to learn
Don't be shy just blame me
Well, there is no
Need to feel ashamed
Remember the oath
Wake up
It's time to cross the border
Is it true what they say
About the part you've played?
Enjoy your stay here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
Please understand
It's not in our hands
Barren the land
It's all dead and gone
And still the tyrant's face is red
So witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
It's the sweetest taste
King of terror just stop wining
Hold your breath it won't take long
Realize this is your judgement day
In between the killing carry on
There are no rules here
Try to understand
You're the artificial enemy
An illusion we all need
For our sake
We're not allowed to see beyond that's your skill
Will we ever learn the lesson "We can't fly with broken wings"
Break the chains
Time to change
I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part
It's been nice we now get to the climax
Your destination's unknown
Just get out of my way
Don't mind the blood here
(No more gods)

A wooden cup and a crown of thorns
Will set up the stage for the cross
I rent a room next door
There is nothing more
No further voices to hear
I'll be free
It doesn't matter anymore that someone's knocking at my door
I've known it long before the Galilean's on the floor
Shame on me, shame on me
I'm a tool and nothing more
I can feel it's getting nearer
Images they'll turn out clearer
Creeps in and out of your mind
I'm destiny personified
I know there's something more behind
But is it really justified
To sacrifice, to crucify
The rescue of the human kind
Sadly sings destiny
"For ages I've been waiting
Now spring is in the air
Let it in"
I hear them howling hear them scream
The raging mob turns mad it seems
"The king's in town
We need a crown"
I think we all know how it ends
"So we're not going take it longer"
So all I know is I don't care
Now we are aware
There I tie the ass
There I tie the colt
Begging for a last chance I hear the voices say
"We get him home tonight and that's all you need to know"
I'm alone
So I can't stand it any longer
And don't want to see it all
Nazarene, your vision will come true
Will come true
They'll get you

The faithful crowd is gathered here
Soon they'll appear
The high and mighty show up the king
Is in doubts
"Apart from this beggar here
There's no one like you my dear
Tasting my lips
No one but you and him"
Round the fire everyone should sing
And praise the gracious queen
Round the fire everyone should dance
And we praise the handsome knight
Forever and ever we both will be one
The maiden, the fair and the young
Fell in love
Will you still wait for me?
Will you still cry for me?
Come and take my hand
There's a moment in life when all the years will pass by
And the eyes filled with tears we once shed
We recognize failures, the desperate cries
Of the ones who believed in our lies
Whenever I'll go you'll be with me
My first though and my last
Though we'll depart in bitterness
One day you'll understand
Carry on
Beloved maiden, mine
Or we have to pay the price
Yesterday's memories and melodies
Are gone with the wind, so sad
Snow-white her hands and golden her hair
But she's not the one
Out in the emptiness where everything's pale
There is no sign of you, I'm alone
How I wish you would be here, I'm alone
Telling me it's alright, come rest (your head)
Come rest your head
I'm alone and sadness reigns in my heart
As long as we live it won't go away
We are one but torn apart
Proudly it stands
Until the world's end
The victorious banner of love

I cannot say that I don't care cause I'm aware
Of everyone and everything they're everywhere
Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain, your brain
The cautious hare cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
(He constantly) knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on
Silent creature, filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease, a release
A vanished kingdom falls
It goes on, on and on and again
It goes on, round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head
Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
I will wait for an answer so far
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back
We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation, we're the chosen ones
We're the tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels
Well the time is right you shall be on my (side)
I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen
There is not the slightest doubt at all
Not at all
In lower airs we're ground down by their ignorance
Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer
Round and round it goes on and again oh
I can't get it out of my head
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no
The hopeful he sadly admits there's no hero
No place to hide there is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground
It's you who has said there's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within, it's in your mind

I'm not insane
That's how it seems though
Spiteful, cruel but wise beyond his age
My body fails
My soul will (rise)
The end of life's immortalized
Disease and agony
And I see death through golden eyes
(Beyond the door)
There's something more
It seems there's just one way
On through the heat
I've felt the touch of evil
I still feel
The icy claw in me
For a descent price I've banned kindness from my heart
The spirit of all truth and beauty pawned for my desire
And from the flames
As chance would have it
The Soulforged will come into light
The Soulforged, the stainless will rise
I will never change my mind
I will leave it all behind
And through the hour glass
Everything's grey, everyone's pale
Nor colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
The seat of life's empty and cold
Cadaverous you all seem to me
Stillborn but you're still alive
You're still alive
Truth lies in loneliness
When hope is long gone by
I'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
And welcome you precious night
From a distant time voices echo in the hall
"Come and join us, enter life and everything is gone now"
And through the looking glass
I still fear mortality and
Its loss in the end
(Unlimited) power in my hands
("Mourn for his lost soul
He's cursed and condemned")
The claw of the dragon ascends
Each step I take mMay it hurt may It ache
Leads me further away from the past
But as long as I breathe (and) each smile on my bleak face
I'm on my way to find back to the Peace of mind

Cut off the light, take a look
There's nothing beyond but pain
Suffer in the deepest void
The flame of hope is gone
What have I done?
Denied the father and the son
For a moment it seemed
There's space beyond the spheres
Aflame the night
So clear and bright
Unstable light
(You've been sacrificed in fear)
Now there's one thing for sure
I'm not afraid anymore
Day after day we've been fixed in this bowl for so long
For ages we're captured in shells and crystallized walls
Predestined or punished? By Man or God?
I cannot, I will not
Deny It's false innocence
The age of false innocence
(Take it away from me)
(And) for a while astronomy has moved the Earth
And we've turned around the Sun
(Sanctum Officium)
Has made me believe
"We know for sure you're lying
Would you like to mess with holy science
You know the fear of dying
Would it be worth it to hear you crying"
I've slaughtered truth and I've shattered my heart
Far too long I have played with hellfire
And science has turned into madness
But I should have taken it higher
So I feel, so I feel
Like Judas must have felt before
That Wednesday night near by the tree
(Take It away from me)
Day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
Predestined's our part so we bleed in the name of God
Don't believe in their eternity
We're still held in blindness
And I've been turned into a liar
If there is no heaven there won't be release
(I cannot) I will not

It's warm and tender but very soon it will turn cold
Shadows stare down from the walls
Out of the mist it's coming closer now
It never rains -- it pours on me
So let the saints
Set up the courtyard, the unpleasant cage
The obvious point is I'm insane
Was I aware whom I has slain, I fear I was:
The faceless
The nameless
The bush set on fire
No one ever dared to speak
"Shame on me, I don't believe
The here and now Is all we're living for"
Joyful it seems but
Then suddenly
By one false move it's blown away
Their voices cease it's gone away
Vanished to the point of no return
Witness my last breath
I do not regret
A word I've said
The strong will survive
The weak must die
And out of the mist
It's coming closer now
Sinner and saints --
The grateful slaves
Nature's law instead of God in heaven
From far beyond
I can hear them sing
I hear angels sing
Songs of innocence
I hear the angel sing
Despite the facts are clear
It cannot be, what we can't see
I must admit, it sounds so sweet
Angels sing
(Can hear them sing)
Far beyond I hear them sing
("It's true) it's true
We don't exist"
From far beyond I hear them sing
Well we all know there's no other side
It's good and evil
I know right between, there's no borderline
This is the punishment divine
Surrounded by night, I've been offered insight
There is none but the sin of pride
Am I wrong am I right? Am I losing my sight?
Abandoning the superior mind
(Right away)
Through the valleys grey
(I will be gone)
Through the shapeless land I walk alone
I'm left alone
Through the deepest void, a blackened paradise
I walk alone, I'm left alone

Turn your head and see the fields of flames
(Don't move along)
He carries along
(Cause things they will go wrong)
From a distant place
(The end is getting closer)
He's on his way
(Day by day)
He'll bring decay
In shades of grey
We're doomed to face the night
Light's out of sight
Since we've reached the point of no return
We pray for the starlight we wait for the Moon
The sky is empty, alone in the unknown
we're getting nowhere
We have been betrayed by the wind and the rain
The sacred hall's empty and cold
The sacrifice made should not be done in vain
Revenge will be taken by Rome
We live a lie
Under the dying moon
Pale-faced laughs doom
Indulges in delight
It's getting out of hand
The final curtain will fall
Hear my voice
There is no choice
There's no way out
You'll find out
We don't regret it
So many men have failed but now he's (gone)
Go out and get it
The madman's head it shall be thine
That someone else dies hidden in (disguise)
Orion's hound shines bright
Don't you think it's time to stop the chase
Around the ring
Just stop running, running
Round the ring
Don't you know that fate has been decided
By the gods
Feel the distance, distance
Out of reach
Welcome to the end
Watch your step, Cassandra, you may fall
As I've stumbled on the field
Find myself in darkest places
(Sister mine)
Find myself drifting away
(Death's a certain thing)
And the other world
The other world appears
Find myself she dies in vain
I cannot be freed, I'm falling down
As time runs faster, moves towards disaster
The ferryman will wait for you, my dear
And then there was silence
Just a voice from the other world
Like a leaf in an icy world
Memories will fade
Misty tales and Poems lost
All the bliss and beauty
Will be gone
Will my weary soul find release for a while
At the moment of death I will smile
It's the triumph of shame and disease
In the end (Iliad)
Raise my hands and praise the day
Break the spell show me the (way)
In decay
The flame of Troy will shine bright
The newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
The newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
Good choice?
Bad choice?
Out of three you've chosen misery
Power and wisdom you deny
(Bad choice, bad choice)
War is the only answer when Love will conquer fear
So the judgement's been made
To the fairest the graceful says
Badly he fails
(Warning)
Fear the heat of passion, father king
(Don't let him in
Don't let her in)
Desire, lust, obsession
Death they'll bring
(We can't get out
Once they are in)
She's like the sunrise
Outshines the Moon at night
Precious like starlight
She will bring in a murderous price
(In darkness grows the seed of man's defeat)
Jealousy
(I can clearly see the end now)
I can clearly see the end now
(The thread of life is spun)
The coin's been placed below my tongue
Never give up
Never give in
Be on our side so we can win
Be on out side
(Old moon's time) is soon to come
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nothing to lose like one we'll stand
We'll face the storm
Created by a man
Roar Roar Roar Roar
Troy (Troy Troy Troy)
And as the lion slaughters man
I am the wolf and you're the lamb
(Hallowed) Troy will fall round the walls
Faith is shattered, bodies fall
It's all for one and one for all
We live for will be wiped out
I feel that something's (wrong)
Surprise, surprise they're gone
Full moon your time goes by
And new moon's still kept out of sight
We live
(We die)
All the bliss and beauty will be gone
Roam in darkness
(Spread the vision)
(Roam in darkness)
(We will be lost if you truly believe)
Troy in darkness
(There's a cold emptiness in our hearts)
That they've gone away
(And) won't come back
They'll tear down the wall to bring it in
They'll truly believe in the lie
Lie, lie
With blossoms they'll welcome the old foe
The vision's so clear
When day and dream unite the end is near
You better be prepared
The nightmare shall be over now, there's nothing more to fear
Come join in our singing and dance with us now
The war it is over forevermore
No hope
The blind leads the blind
Carry on
Though future's denied
Mare or stallion
There's far more inside
We are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die
(Will) my weary soul find release for a while
Holy light shines on
We're condemned though the trial's far ahead
The crack of doom, Father
Your handsome son is heading home
Still the wind blows, calm and silent
Carries news from a distant shore
(Out of mind)
(Can't get it)
(Still the wind blows, calm and silent)
(Carries news from a distant shore)
(Can't get it out of my head)
Sorrow and defeat

Stop be quite now
Out with the light and
Then up and down it goes
Fly
Out with the light
There at the door
The inspiration I've looked for
The spirit of the youth appears
No one ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
It's make believe
Make believe
But one day
It all will come to life
Step out of line
And I'll teach you how to fly
Then away we'll go
Leave your mark land of mine
Leave your mark
In the land of mine
The second one to right
And then straight on
Until morning light
No irritation
No, not the slightest doubt
We got once
Quick - we better hurry
There from the road I sense
The end of fun gets near
Wonderful thoughts
And imaginations
These things will lift you up
What is it like?
You ask me, my dear
Will there be fairies
Or things to fear?
For fairies sake I'd say
You better come with me
So soon you'll see
Now up and down it goes
And round
Round and round and round
Praise
To my cleverness
They all follow me
All praise to innocence
That's everything it needs
Fly in
Fly out
They'll leave it all behind
No one ever dares to speak...
Life is a map
And it is quite confusing
The lights are up
Now let the play begin
She flies, she flies
Into the light she flies
No words like "Just" in mind
She's finding Neverland
There on the day she dies
Don't stop it now
She still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now, now, now
