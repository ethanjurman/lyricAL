It's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout, shout
You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all
Stand up and shout
Let it out
You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again
You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire, go on, explode

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me?
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out!
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never dies
Life's a never-ending wheel, say
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah!
Oh what's becoming of me? No! No!
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy Diver, sole survivor
You're the one who's clean
Holy Diver, Holy Diver
There's a cat in the blue coming after you, Holy Diver
Oh Holy Diver
Yeah, alright
Get away, get away, get away
Hmm hmm hmm

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white
Well I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail
You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy
Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin
So I'm ridin'
Well I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
Well she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'Cause you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right
So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin'
Yes I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Flying away in the clouds
You know you're losing your control
And finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow
You can feel it
You can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You break it off in the middle

Don't talk to strangers
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down
Hey, you, you know me
You can touch me I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see
Can you feel me?
I'm danger, I'm the stranger
And I, I'm darkness
I'm anger, I'm pain
I, I'm the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away, go
No, no, don't let them in your mind
Protect your soul
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down yeah
Run, run, run, run away

Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all
Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel
And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found
Oh here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one never told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no
But here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
In the middle of the heart
Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right through your heart
And here it comes, here it comes again
Straight through the heart

If your circle stays unbroken
Then you're a lucky man
'Cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
Lies the chalice of the soul
And it's likely you might find the answer there
She had thirteen years of teenage tears
And never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
She saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
A smile inside a frown
And in the light, the answer right
Inside her coming down
It said
I can go away
I can leave here
I can be invisible
I go away
He was just eighteen and in-between
A lady and a man
His daddy's girl in mama's world
That was when he ran
You know the word confused has been abused
But that's just what he was
And then the spark inside the dark
The answer came because it said
You can go away
You can leave here
You can be invisible
Well I grew up quick and I felt the kick
Of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and then I took a fast look
At just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
From the two that came before
The only way to really stay
Is to walk right out the door
So I go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible
Go away again
I can go away
When I leave here
I can be invisible
I said, when you can go away
Lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just become invisible
I went away
Disappeared before your eyes
You never touch me, you never feel me
You'll never see me again
Because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
We're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
To be invisible
To go away

When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold
Lost my hold to the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark
Do your demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I, we're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah
When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear
It calling you beware
Look out
There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark, whoa oh oh

Shame on the night
For places I've been
And what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
Oh so shame on the night
All right
And shame on you
You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
And I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say, oh, shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh Lord, just go the way you came again
Oh, shame on the night
So I know I'd better run
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh, shame on the night
Here I go, I've got to run
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Well, I lost my hold on the magic flame
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
[evil laughter fading]

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing, they leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind can penetrate your mind
But sail on, sing your song, carry on
Cause we rock, we rock
We rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices, all giving choices
If we listen, they will say, oh we can find the way
But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
We rock, we rock
Sail on, sing your song, carry on
Ride out, stand and shout, carry on
See how we rock
We rock, that's rock

We're the ship without a storm
The cold without the warm
Light inside the darkness
That it needs, yeah
We're a laugh without tear
The hope without the fear
We are coming, home
We're off to the witch
We may never, never, never, come home
But the magic that we'll feel
Is worth the lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
We're the throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way is down
We don't come alone
We are fire, we are stone
We're the hand that writes
Then quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line, yeah
We're the last in line
Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies
Between the good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase
Is worth the pain
We're the last in line, oh
Yeah, we're off to the witch
We may never, never, never come home
Is worth a lifetime
You know we're the throw before the toss
But the only way to go is down
See how we shine
We're the last in
We're the first in line, oh
We're a ship without a storm
We're the cold inside the warm
We're the laugh without tear
We're the smile without the mirror

You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
'Cause you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn
You're breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, willing to learn

Alright
Dark touches, send rushes through the brain
Black's whiter, burns brighter than the flame
No shadows, just whispers in the wind
No faces, just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure
I hate the light
I speed at night
At night
Alright!
My demons, they seem to disappear
No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've got some stairs to heaven
You may be right
I only know in my world
You've got some stairs to heaven you may be right
I speed at night yeah!
I speed at night night night night night
No shadows, no faces, just whispers in dark places
I speed at night alright

Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But riders in the night
Can lift you out of sight when they call
That's all
My Sally was a princess
And she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of
One night in the city
One night looking pretty
Then someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright
Where dark is always light
There's no day, no way
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come, steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch?
Do you see?
Do you know the people in me?
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
I'm the poor, I'm the sure
I'm the holy, I'm the pure
I can tell you tales
You just might not believe
One night, one night
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away
And one child stayed to play for
One night touching pretty
But chains don't make a wall
And dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night
When dreams make up the light
One night
One night feeling pretty
Feeling pretty, pretty, pretty
Pretty, pretty in the city
One child went away
And one child stayed to play
Chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up
Where they fall, in the city

Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know, no, no
It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, they'll see you anyway
Evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, evil eyes
They'll follow forever
'Cause they're evil eyes
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes

Can you hear me?
Can you see there's a storm
On the edge of the sky?
Does it matter?
Well, it does to me
And I can tell you why
You know when there's thunder
There should be rain
But it don't always follow the rule, no
And is the wise man always right?
No, he can play the fool
It's always a mystery
Not what it seems to be
Just like you and me
Always a mystery
We are lightning, we are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark
When there's no fire, if no-one sees
There is only the dark
Just imagine, will you try?
I can see that you've opened your mind
Silver linings can disappear
But they always shine
Not what you want to see

Well, it's been a long hot road I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there, no, no
And all the promises of springtime
Turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light, all right
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer
All on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out
You've been hungry all of your life, yeah
We speed across emotion
And then we lose our hold
We turn on wheels of passion
That we can't control
So eat your heart out
Run to the shadows and hide
All on fire then he dies, then he dies, then he dies

In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine
Then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came
And the people knew
That the chains were on
My, my, my
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand
As it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me
And that's free but still
Your chains are on
Yes, your chains are on
Still, your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen them flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
Oh my, the chains were on
Where the chains are on
In the land of milk and honey
Still, the chains are on
Where the queen lies dark and lonely
Still, her chains are on
And the world was new and magic
But the chains are on
The chains were on, the chains were on
Yeah, the chains were on
Seen them walking on the water
The chains were on
Seen them flying through the sky
My, the chains were on
Yes, the chains were on

Oh running into nowhere turning like a wheel and a year becomes a day
Whenever we dream that's when we fly so here is a dream for just you and I
We'll fin the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heart
Oh here we see the wizard staring through the glass and he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie and the things you've got to do yeah
Oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
But oh sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night oh look to the light
Well you fight to kill the dragon and bargain with the beast and sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow and never leave the ground and still you don't know why
Whenever you dream you're holding the key it opens the door to let you be free yeah
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heart
A shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack and he's looking right at you quick
Run along the rainbow before it turns to black attack
And oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
Oh sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart yeah bleeding in the night yeah yeah 
We'll find the sacred heart

She's a rumor in the night it's crazy you can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light it's crazy but you go anywhere
It was just a summer night maybe when a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away maybe to go where where where
She crouches the hunter ready to tell you another lie another lie
You could see the side of someday feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway you were wrong wrong wrong
She jumped at the moment a chance to tell you another lie another lie another lie

You look and you know she's telling you another lie another lie another lie
Why it's crazy when you feel you're getting stronger another lie
Why it's crazy all the lies are getting longer another lie
Who oh yeah another lie another lie

It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door
She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar
The devil of one another
Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody broke a heart
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Without a friend
But they got Rock 'N' Roll
On the night that they cried forever

Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman oh oh oh
Anybody can anybody can sunset superman oh oh oh 

There's perfect harmony in the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness hunted by the lion and the lamb ah ah ah ah
We bring you fantasy we bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle or we will disappear never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away sailed away
We bring you beautiful we teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe or we will disappear never to return again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away they sailed away sailed away
And as we drift along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle and a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds and then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness just lost like them and part of all the pain that they feel yeah
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away leaving nothing nothing more to say all the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful and they'll always let you in
But doors are never open to the child without a trace of sin sail away

Two faces on fire no traces something has swallowed the night you know that nothing can make it all right yeah
Like candy emotion too much and sugar can turn to sand you scream but nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain or do we see just what we are we're naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children guns loaded take aim and blow all the dreams away too late for anything better to say hey
Are we just crazy with the pain or do we see just what we are we are 
Naked in the rain naked in the rain maked in the rain
Two faces no fire no traces fever has turned to snow hearts break to show you the way as you go oh
Are we just running from the pain or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children on fire emotion burns higher guns loaded blow all the dreams away
Naked in the rain naked in the rain frightened by the pain naked in the rain

Seems like heard this song at least a thousand times before 
He just wanted her but she wants more so build a wall keep it all to herself oh oh
Always never seemed to be too much reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains sad remains another victim of overlove overlove
He was just the devil in a thing disquise jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page close the cage on another victim of overlove
Overlove yeah overlove overlove overlove overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone and come the dawn you got another victim of overlove
Overlove overlove overlove love love love love overlove

Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back and everytime there's sunshine I'm blind yeah
I am everybody and everyone that I know is me everyone that I know won't see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star I could have been a dreamer yeah
I'm another number and you know the numbers must agree but everytime the wind blows I can't fly why
We take away tomorrow and never see the end of today lock it up and send it away forever
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star 
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are I could have been a dreamer oh oh
Running with the wolf pack feel like I'm never coming back but maybe that was sunshine that I saw
I've heard about a rainbow I've heard it makes you crazy I think I'm goin' crazy crazy 'cause I see
I could have been a dreamer I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer 'cause dreams are what we are
I could have been a dreamer I could have been the one to fly
I always could have been a dreamer 'cause dreamers never die no
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer dreamer
I could have been a dreamer dreamer I could have been a dreamer

Give me shelter shelter I can face the day then I'll just fade away give me shelter give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly the fire starts to die you open up your eyes 
Faces in the window noises in the night
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window
We are evil and we are all divine creations of the mind we are pleasure
I see clearly who's behind the wall yes I can see us all
We're faces in the window noises in the night
Give me shelter shelter shelter give me shelter shelter shelter
Faces in the window noises in the night faces in the window hiding from the light
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window
When the fire starts to die and you open up your eyes there they are in the window faces in the window
We are evil and divine just creations of the mind and faces in the window faces in the window

Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move they're shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire burning through your brain turn to face the train oh oh
Hey it's magic said the mother to the child it's stronger than a smile let it go
When a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah when a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah
Just when you think it's pretend here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever maybe we'll still just never know oh oh
Stars move shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire magic shakin' all the earth when a woman cries
Oh oh stars move thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky when a woman cries
When a woman cries aah when a woman cries yeah yeah 
When a woman cries when a woman cries oh

Silence - we hunt for the queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between
Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play hey-hey
Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Silence - we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold
Oh to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more
More's been empty for years
Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you
Small gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon

Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do
The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spider
Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes
Now I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Don't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wild
Why do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hear
Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
A spider
Inside her

You've made it through another day
Driving past the backroads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you
Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun
We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in
Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
No pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel
Some friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my way
Scream at the crazy ones
Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you
Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again
Again, again, again...

I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night - black as heaven
So no-one saw the gun
Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back around
Clutching to monsters in shadows
I can disappear - gone
Better in the dark

If they take away your song
You can finally hear the voices
Of the ones that don't belong
In the face of the rising wind
We all sing Gloria
Is there flame without fire
Most unlikely
If you're there when the walls come down
We all sing - warrior
Is there sight without sound
But we got rock and roll
Rock and roll
Take me anywhere
Is there someone there
On the edge of the last goodbye
Ah the brave never die
Hey, send your heroes of to war
But whisper in their ear
Never cross the song police
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again
For the sake of the left behind
Soon forgotten by time
So unlikely
Cause we got rock and roll
Take you anywhere
Someone's always there
Bring me anywhere
Rock and roll me, ah

You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push
You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
Go on and push

He'd never tell her lies
And she believed in magic
But when the magic died
She could see that all along he's just been
Guilty - a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty - burn in fire
It's time to say goodbye
Don't tell another story
Another alibi
Now you see that all along he's just been
Guilty - you burn in fire
Guilty - the great pretender
You're guilty - just surrender cause you're guilty
Broken promise
But please forgive again
One more time for me
It's the very last time - you'll see
Guilty - liar, liar
You'll burn in fire
Guilty - just surrender, you're guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty
A liar, liar
Guilty - you'll burn in fire
Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire
Surrender - guilty
So guilty

Oh-oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness
Wakes the dead
Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder
And she's afraid
Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
I'll make you safe and warm
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is no more little girl
Don't see her anymore
They disappear
Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today I heard that she was dead
You can hear them only if you try
Goodbye

Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousine
Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio
But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall
Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no
Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall
Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine
And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah

Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the show
The same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son
I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old time
There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Will you need more?
Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh
