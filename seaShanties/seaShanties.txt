When the Alabama's keel was laid
Roll Alabama, roll
They laid her keel at Birkenhead
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

Oh, she was built in Birkenhead
Built in the yard of Jonathan Laird

Away down the Mersey she rolled one day
And across the Western she ploughed her way

With British guns, oh, she was stocked
She sailed from Fayal, in Cherbourg she docked

To fight the north Semmes did employ
Any method to kill and destroy

But off Cherbourg the Kearsage lay tight
Awaiting was Winslow to start a good fight

Outside the three mile limit they fought
An Semmes escaped on a fine British yacht

The Kearsage won - Alabama so brave
Sank to the bottom of a watery grave

In the Black Ball line I served my time
To me way-aye-aye, hurray-ah
And that's the line where you can shine
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line
The Black Ball Ships are good and true
They are the ships for me and you
For once there was a Black Ball Ship
That fourteen knots an hour could clip
They'll carry you along through frost and snow
And take you where the wind don't blow
You will surely find a rich gold mine
Just take a trip in the Black Ball Line
Just take a trip to Liverpool
To Liverpool, that Yankee school
The Yankee sailors you'll see there
With red-top boots and short-cut hair
At Liverpool docks we bid adieu
To Poll and Bet and lovely Sue
And now we're bound for New York Town
It's there we'll drink, and sorrow drown

My clothes are all in pawn
Go down you blood red roses, go down
And it's mighty draughty around Cape Horn
Go down you blood red roses, go down
Oh, you pinks and posies
Go down you blood red roses, go down
It's round Cape Horn we've got to go
Chasing whales through ice and snow
Oh my old mother she wrote to me
My darling son come home from sea
Oh it's one more pull and that will do
For we're the bullies to kick her through

Up jumps a crab with his crooked legs
Saying you play the cribbage and I'll stick the pegs
Singing blow the wind westerly, let the wind blow
By a gentle nor'wester how steady she goes
Up jumps a dolphin with his chuckle-head
He jumps on the deck saying pull out the lead!
Up jumps a flounder so flat on the ground
Saying damn your old chocolate, mind how you sound
Up jumps a salmon so bright as the sun
He jumped down between the decks and fired off a gun
Up jumps a whale, the biggest of all
He jumped up aloft and he's pawl after pawl
Up jumps a herring, the king of the sea
He jumps up on deck saying helms a-lee!
Up jumps a shark with his big row of teeth
He jumped up between the decks and shook out the reefs

Come all ye young fellows that follows the sea
To me, way hey, blow the man down
Now please pay attention and listen to me
Give me some time to blow the man down
I'm a deep water sailor just come from Hong Kong
You give me some whiskey, I'll sing you a song
When a trim Black Ball liner's preparing for sea
On a trim Black Ball liner I wasted me prime
When a trim Black Ball liner preparing for sea
You'll split your sides laughing such sights you would see
There's tinkers and tailors, shoemakers and all
They're all shipped for sailors aboard the Black Ball
When a big Black Ball liner's a-leaving her dock
The boys and the girls on the pier-head do flock
Now, when the big liner, she's clear of land
Our bosun he roars out the word of command
Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop
Or I'll help you along with the toe of me boot
Pay attention to orders, now, you one and all
For see high above there flies the Black Ball
'Tis larboard and starboard, on deck you will sprawl
For kicking Jack Rogers commands the Black Ball

Our anchor's aweigh and our sails are all set
Bold Riley, oh, boom-a-lay
The folks we are leaving, we'll never forget
Bold Riley, oh, gone away
Goodbye, me darling. Goodbye, me dear, oh
Bold Riley, oh, boom-a-lay
Goodbye, me darling. Goodbye, me dear, oh
Bold Riley, oh, gone away
Wake up Mary Ellen and don't look so glum
By Whitestocking time you'll be drinking hot rum
The rain it is raining now all the day long
And the northerly wind, it does blow so strong
We're outward and bound for Bengal bay
Get bending, me boys, it's a hell of a way

So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley

I'll leave my gal and go a-whalin'
So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley
So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley

Cape Cod girls ain't got no combs
Haul away, haul away
They brush their hair with codfish bones
And we're bound away for Australia
So heave away, me bully, bully boys
Haul away, haul away
Heave her up and don't you make a noise
And we're bound away for Australia
Cape Cod kids ain't got no sleds
They slide down the hills on codfish heads
Cape Cod girls ain't got no frills
They tie their hair with codfish gills
Cape Cod cats ain't got no tails
They lost them all in the northeast gales

Oh, poor old man your horse will die
And we say so, and we know so
Oh, poor old man your horse will die
Oh, poor old man
We'll hoist him up to the main yardarm
We'll hoist him up to the main yardarm
Say, I old man your horse will die
Say, I old man your horse will die
We'll drop him down to the depths of the sea
We'll drop him down to the bottom of the sea
We'll sing him down with a long, long roll
Where the sharks'll have his body and the devil have have his soul

What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
Early in the morning?
Way-hay, up she rises
Way-hay, up she rises
Way-hay, up she rises
Early in the morning
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Pull out the bung and wet him all over
Put him in the scuppers with the deck pump on him
Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowlin'
Tie him to the taffrail when she's yard-arm under

Essiquibo river is the queen of rivers all

General Taylor gained the day
Walk him along, John, carry him along
General Taylor gained the day
Carry him to his burying ground
To me way hay, you stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
To me way hay, stormy
Carry him to his burying ground
General Taylor died long ago
He's gone, me boys, where the winds never blow
We lowered him down with a silver chain
We made sure he wouldn't rise again
We dug his grave with a silver spade
His shroud of finest silk was made
General Taylor gained the day
General Taylor gained the day

We're going away to leave you now
Good bye, fare thee well
Good bye, fare thee well
We're going away to leave you now
Hoorah, me boys, we're homeward bound
Ah, give me the girl with the bonny brown hair
Your hair of brown is the talk of the town
So fare you we're homeward bound
Homeward bound to Liverpool town
So fill up your glasses for those who were kind
And drink to the girls we leaving behind
We're homeward bound I hear them say
We're homeward bound with eleven months pay
Our anchor we'll weigh, our sails we will set
The friends we are leaving we'll never forget

Louis was the king of France
Before the revolut-i-on
Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe
But then he got his head chopped off
Which spoiled his constitut-i-on
Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe
(To me) way, haul away
We'll heave and hang together
Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe
Once I was in Ireland
Digging turf and pratties
And now I'm on a Yankee ship
Hauling on sheets and braces
Now when I was a little boy
And so me mother told me
That if I didn't kiss the girls
Me lips would all grow mouldy
Way haul away
We'll haul away the bowline
Way, haul away
The packet is a-rollin'

Come get your duds in order
For we're going to leave tomorrow
Heave away, me jollies, heave away
Come get your duds in order
For we're going to cross the water
Heave away me jolly boys, we're all bound away
Sometimes we're bound for Liverpool
Sometimes we're bound for Spain
But now we're bound for St. John's town
To watch the girls a-dancing
Now it's farewell Maggie darling
For it's now I'm going to leave you
You promised me you'd marry me
But how you did deceive me
I wrote me love a letter
And I signed it with a ring
I wrote me love a letter
I was on the Jenny Lind
Sometimes we're bound for Liverpool
Sometimes we're bound for Spain
But now we're bound for St. John's town
To watch the girls a-dancing

Was you ever in Quebec
Bonny laddie, hieland laddie
Stowing timber on the deck
Bonny hieland ladie
Hey ho and away we go
Bonny laddie, hieland laddie
Hey ho and away we go
Bonny hieland ladie
Was you ever in Merashee
Where you stayed fast to tree
Was you ever in Baltimore
Dancin' on that sanded floor
Was you ever in Balville bay
Where the girls are all the go

There were two lofty ships
From old England came
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
One was the Prince of Luther
The other Prince of Wales
All a-cruisin' down the coast
Of High Barbary
Aloft there, aloft there
Our jolly bosun cried
Look ahead, look astern,
Look to weather an' a-lee
There's naught upon the stern, sir
There's naught upon our lee
But there's a lofty ship to wind'ard
An' she's sailin' fast and free
Oh hail her, oh hail her
Our gallant captain cried
Are you a man-o-war
Or a privateer? cried he
Oh, I'm not a man-o-war
Nor privateer, said he
But I am salt sea pirate
All a-looking for me fee
For Broadside, for broadside
A long time we lay
'Til at last the Prince of Luther
Shot the pirate's mast away
Oh quarter, oh quarter
Those pirates they did cry
But the quarter that we gave them
Was we sank 'em in the sea

Go fetch me down me riding cane
For I'm off to see me darlin' Jane
With a hog-eye
Railroad navie with his hog-eye
Roll ashore and a hog-eye, oh
She wants the hog-eye man
Oh, the hog-eye men are all the go
When they come to San Francisco
Now, it's who's been here since I've been gone
Well, a railroad navie with his sea boots on
Oh, Sally in the garden, picking peas
Her golden hair hanging down to her knees
Oh, sally in the garden, shelling peas
With a little hog-eye all sitting on her knees
Well, a hog ship, and a hog-eye crew
Hog-eye mate and a skipper too

From Liverpool docks we bid adieu
To Suke, and Sal, and Kittie too
The anchor's weighed and the sails unfurl
We're bound to cross the watery row
For we know we're outward bound
Hurrah, we're outward bound

The wind it blows from the east nor'east
Our ship will scud ten knots at least
The purser would our wants supply
So while with life we'll never say die
And should we touch at Malabar
Or any other quarters far
Our purser he will tip the chink
And just like fishes we will drink
Then at last our captain comes on board
Our sails are bent, we're manned and stored
The Peter's hoisted at the fore
Good-bye to the girls we'll see no more
For we know we're homeward bound
Hurrah, we're homeward bound
One day the man on the look-out
Proclaims a sail with a joyful shout
Can you make her out? 
I think I can, She's a pilot standing out from the land
And when we're hauled into Liverpool docks
Them bloomers all come 'round in flocks
Them pretty girls, we hear 'em say
Here comes Jack with his twelve-month pay
Next we go to the Dog and Bell
Where there's good vittle there to sell
When in comes Archie with a smile
Drink up me boys, it's worth your while
When poor Jack's money is gone and spent
Nor more to be had, no more to be lent
Then in comes Archie with a frown
Saying Rise up Jack, let John sit down
And so poor Jack must understand
There's ships in the harbour needing hands
So stows his gear like he did before
And says farewell to the Liverpool shore
For he knows he's outward bound
Hurrah, he's outward bound

Well a hundred years on the eastern shore
Oh yes, Oh
Oh, a hundred years on the eastern shore
A Hundred years ago
Well its Bully John from Baltimore
Well I knew him well on the eastern shore
Well it's Bully John's the boy for me
He's a buckle on land and a bully at sea
Well its been a long time and a very long time
Well its been a long time since I made this rhyme
Well my old mother she wrote to me
Me darling son come home from sea
Well I thought I heard the first mate cry
That bleeding top main sheave is dry
Well I thought I heard the old man say
Well it's one more pull and then belay

Our packet is the Island Lass
Lowlands, lowlands, lowlands, low
There's a laddie howlin' at the main topmast
Our skipper comes from Barbados
He's got the name of Hammer Toes
He feeds us bread as hard as brass
Our junk's as salt as a bailer's arse
The monkey wears a sailor's clothes
Now, where he got 'em from, God only knows
It's up aloft that yard must go
Up aloft from down below
We'll haul 'em high and let 'em dry
We'll trice 'em up into the sky
Lowlands, me boys, and up she goes
Get changed, me boys, for your shore-going clothes

John Cherokee was an indian man
Alabama John Cherokee
He run away every time he can
Alabama John Cherokee, way, hey, yah
Alabama John Cherokee, way, hey, yah
Alabama John Cherokee
They put him aboard a Yankee ship
Again he gave the boss the slip
They catch him again and chain him tight
And starve him many a day and night
Nothing to drink and nothin to eat
He just fall dead at the boss's feet
So they bury him by the old gate post
The very same day you can see his ghost

Juliana, Juliana where do you go?
Ah ha, me London Julie
Juliana, Juliana where do you go?
Ah ha, me London Julie
Juliana, Juliana where do you go?
Ah ha, me London Julie
Juliana, Juliana where do you go?
Ah ha, me London Julie
Up aloft, up aloft this spar must go
Up aloft, up aloft from down below
Around Cape Horn there's ice and snow
But around Cape Horn we've got to go
The mate is a-bawlin' down below
So heave away, let's stamp and go

I thought I heard the old man say
John Kanaka-naka too lie ay
Today, today is a holiday
John Kanaka-naka too lie ay
Too lie ay, oh, to lie ay
John Kanaka-naka too lie ay
We'll work tomorrow but no work today
We'll work tomorrow but no work today
We're bound away for 'Frisco Bay
We're bound away at the break of day
We're bound away 'round Cape Horn
We wish to Christ we'd never been born
Oh haul, oh haul, oh haul away
Oh haul away and make your pay
And we are Liverpool born and bred
We're strong in the arm but we're thick in the head

Oh the times was hard and the wages low
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
And the grub was bad and the gales did blow
And it's time for us to leave her
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
For the voyage is done and the winds do blow
And it's time for us to leave her
I thought I heard the Old Man say
You can go ashore and take your pay
Oh her stern was foul and the voyage was long
The winds was bad and the gales was strong
And we'll leave her tight and we'll leave her trim
And heave the hungry packet in
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her with a grin
For there's many a worser we've sailed in
And now it's time to say goodbye
For the old pierhead's a-drawing nigh

When I was young lad I sailed with the rest
On a Liverpool packet bound out to the west
We anchored one day in the harbour of Cork
Then put out to sea for the port of New York
And it's row, row bullies row
Them Liverpool Judies have got us in tow
For 42 days we were hungry and sore
The winds were against us, the gales they did roar
Off Battery Point we did anchor at last
Our jib boom hove in and our canvas all fast
The boardinghouse masters came aboard in a trice
A shouting and a promising all that was nice
Til one fat old crib took a liking to me
Says he you're a fool, lad, to follow the sea
Says he there's a job as is waiting for you
With lashings of liquor and beggar-all to do
Says he what you say lad, will you ? or two
Says I you old bastard, I'm damned if I do
Next I remember I woke in the morn
On a the three skysail yarder bound south round Cape Horn
With an old set of oilskins and two pair of socks
And a blooming great head and a case of the pox
So come all you young sailors take a warning by me
Keep your eye on the drinks when liquor is free
Don't pay no attention to runner or whore
Or your head'll be thick and your throat will be sore

Oh, have you heard the news, me Johnny
One more day
We're homeward bound tomorrow
One more day
Only one more day, me Johnny
One more day
Oh, rock and roll me over
One more day
Don't you hear the old man growlin'
Don't you hear the mate a howlin'
Don't you hear the caps'n pawlin'
Don't you hear the pilot bawlin'
Only one more day a-howlin'
Can't you hear the gals a-callin'
Only one more day a-rollin'
Can't you hear the gulls a-callin'
Only one more day a-furlin'
Only one more day a-cursin'
Oh, heave and sight the anchor, Johnny
For we're close aboard the port, Johnny
Only one more day for Johnny
And your pay-day's nearly due, Johnny
Then put out your long-tail blue, Johnny
Make your port and take your pay, Johnny
Only one more day a-pumpin', Johnny
Only one more day a-bracin'
Oh, we're homeward bound today, Johnny
We'll leave her without sorrow, Johnny
Pack your bags today me Johnny
Oh, an' leave her where she lies, Johnny
Only one more day a-workin', Johnny
Oh, come rock 'n' roll me over
No more gales or heavy weather
Only one more day together

It's a damn tough life full of toil and strife
We whalermen undergo
And we don't give a damn when the gale is done
How hard the winds do blow
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Sound
With a good ship taut and free
And we don't give a damn when we drink our rum
With the girls of Old Maui
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground
Rolling down to Old Maui
Once more we sail with a Northerly gale
Through the ice, and wind, and rain
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands
We soon shall see again
Six hellish months we passed away
On the cold Kamchatka sea
But now we're bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui
Once more we sail the Northerly gale
Towards our Island home
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done
And we ain't got far to roam
Our stans'l booms is carried away
What care we for that sound
A living gale after us
Thank God we're homeward bound
How soft the breeze through the island trees
Now the ice is far astern
Them native maids, them tropical glades
Is awaiting our return
Even now their big, brown eyes look out
Hoping some fine to see
Our baggy sails running 'fore the gales
Rolling down to Old Maui
We'll heave the lead where old Diamond Head
Looms up on old Wahu
Our masts and yards are sheathed with ice
And our desks are hid from view
The horrid ice of the sea-caked isles
That deck the Arctic sea
Are miles behind in the frozen wind
Since we steered for Old Maui
And now we're anchoured in the bay
With the Kanakas all around
With chants and soft aloha-oos
They greet us homeward bound
And now ashore we'll have good fun
We'll paint them beaches red
Awakening in the arms of an island maid
With a big fat aching head

Away down south where the cocks do crow
Way down in Florida
The gals they all play the old Banjo
And we'll roll the woodpile down
Rollin', rollin', rollin' the whole world round
That brown gal o' mine's down the Georgia line
And we'll roll the woodpile down
When I was a young man in my prime
I'd clench them yeller girls two at a time
We'll roll 'em high and we'll roll 'em low
We'll heave 'em up and away we'll go
It's rouse and bust 'er is the cry
A black man's wage is never high
Oh, one more heave, and that'll do
For we're the bullies to kick her through

O say was you ever in Rio Grande?
Way, you Rio
It's there that the river runs down golden sand
For we're bound to the Rio Grande
And away, boys, away
Way, you Rio
Sing fare you well my pretty young girls
For we're bound to the Rio Grande
Oh, New York town is no place for me
I'll pack up my bag and go out to sea
So it's pack up your donkey and get under way
The girls we are leaving can take our half pay
We'll sell our salt cod for molasses and rum
And get home again 'fore Thanksgiving has come
Sing good bye to Nellie and good bye to Sue
And you who are listening, good bye to you
And good-bye, fare you well, all you ladies of town
We've left you enough for to buy a silk gown
Now you Bowery ladies we'd have you to know
We're bound to the south'ard, O Lord, let us go!
Our good ship's a-going out over the bar
And we'll point her nose for the South-er-on Star
Oh say was you ever in Rio Grande?
Oh was you ever on that strand?

Well a night on shore wouldn't do us any harm (x3)
And we'll all hang on behind
And we'll roll the old chariot along (x3)
And we'll all hang on behind
Well a nice watch below
Well a nice glass of beer
Well night with the girls
Well a big pot of gold

Oh Sally she'n the gal that I love dearly
Way, sing Sally oh
Sally she'n the gal that I love dearly
Hilo Johnnie Brown stand to your ground
Oh Sally she's the gal that I splice nearly
Her lips is red and her hair is curly
Oh Sally she'n my 'Badian beauty
Sally gal she know her duty
Oh Sally she'n my bright mulatta
Sally gal she do what she ought to
Oh seven long years I courted Sally
But I don't care for her dilly dally
So I signed onboard of a New Bedford whaler
When I come home she was married to a tailor

Santayana fought for Spain
Heave away Santayana
He fought for Spain and he gained his name
All on the plains of Mexico
And it's heave her up and away we'll go
Heave away Santayana
Heave her up and away we'll go
All on the plains of Mexico
Oh Santayana gained the day
And General Taylor he ran away
Oh General Taylor ran away
At Molly del Rey he gained his fame
When I was a young man in my prime
I'd kiss them pretty girls two at a time
But now I'm old and going grey
Oh rum's my sweetheart every day

Oh, I'm going to leave her
Shallow, oh shallow brown
Oh, I'm going to leave her
Shallow brown, shallow brown
Bound away for St. Georges
Bound away for St. Georges
Master's going to sell me
Master's going to sell me
Sell me for the dollar
Great big Spanish dollar
Oh, me clothes is all in order
And me packet leaves tomorrow
Fare thee well my Juliana
Fare thee well my Juliana
Oh, I'm leaving in the morning
Oh, I'm leaving in the morning

Aft on the poopdeck
Walking about
There is the second mate
So sturdy and so stout
What he is thinking of
He only knows himself
Oh, we wish that he would hurry up
And strike, strike the bell
Strike the bell, second mate
Let us go below
Look away to windward
You can see it's going to blow
Look at the glass
You can see that it is fell
We wish the you would hurry up
And strike, strike the bell
Down on the maindeck
Working at the pumps
There is the larboard watch
Ready for their bunks
Over to windward
They see a great swell
They're wishing that the second mate
Would strike, strike the bell
Aft at the wheel
Poor Anderson stands
Grasping the spokes
In his cold, mittened hands
Looking at the compass
The coarse is clear as hell
He's wishing that the second mate
Would strike, strike the bell
For'ad in the fo'c'sle head
Keeping sharp lookout
There is Johnny standing
Ready for to shout
Lights' burning bright, sir
And everything is well
He's wishing that the second mate
Would strike, strike the bell
Aft the quarterdeck
The gallant captain stands
Looking to windward
With his glasses in his hand
What he is thinking of
We know very well
He's thinking more of shortening sail
Than strike, strike the bell

In South Australia I was born
(To me) heave away, haul away
In South Australia round Cape Horn
We're bound for South Australia
Haul away you rolling kings
To me heave away, haul away
Haul away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia
As I walked out one morning fair
'Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair
I shook her up and I shook her down
I shook her round and round the town
I run her all night and I run her all day
And I run her until we sailed away
There ain't but one thing grieves me mind
To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind
And as we wallop around Cape Horn
You'll wish to God you'd never been born
In South Australia my native land
Full of rocks and thieves and fleas and sand
I wish I was on Australia's strand
With a bottle of whiskey in my hand

I wish I was in Mobile Bay, screwing cotton all of the day
But I'm stowing sugar in the hold below,
Below, below, below
Hey, ho, below, below
Stowing sugar in the hold below
Hey, ho, below, below
Stowing sugar in the hold below
The J.M. White, she's a new boat
Stem to stern she's mighty fine
Beat any boat on the New Orleans line
Stowing sugar in the hold below
The engineer shouts through his trumpet
Tell the mate we got bad news.
Can't get steam for the fire in the flue
Stowing sugar in the hold below
The captain's on the quarter deck
Scratchin' 'way at his old neck
And he cries out, Heave the larboard lead
Stowing sugar in the hold below

Tommy's gone on a whaling ship
Away to Hilo
Oh, Tommy's gone on a damn long trip
Tom's gone to Hilo
He never kissed his girl goodbye
He left her and he told her why
She'd robbed him blind and left him broke
He'd had enough, gave her the poke
His half-pay went, it went like chalf
She hung around for the other half
She drank and boozed his pay away
With her weather eye on his next payday
Oh Tommy's gone and left her flat
Oh Tommy's gone and he won't come back

Whiskey-o, Johny-o
Rise her up from down below
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o
Up aloft this yard must go
John rise her up from down below
Now whiskey is the life of man
Always was since the world began
Now whiskey gave me a broken nose
And whiskey made me pawn me clothes
Now whiskey is the life of man
Whiskey from that old tin can
I thought I heard the first mate say
I treats me crew in a decent way
A glass of whiskey all around
And a bottle full for the shanty man

Whiskey is the life of man
Always was since the world began
Whiskey-o, Johnny-o
John rise her up from down below
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o
Up aloft this yard must go
John rise her up from down below
Whiskey here, whiskey there
Whiskey almost everywhere
Whiskey up and whiskey down
Whiskey all around the town
Whiskey killed me poor old dad
Whiskey drove me mother mad
My wife and I do not agree
She puts whiskey in her tea
I had a girl and her name was Lize
She puts whiskey in her pies
Oh whiskey straight, and whiskey strong
Give me some whiskey and I'll sing you a song
If whiskey comes too near my nose
I tip it up and down she goes
Some likes whiskey, some likes beer
I wisht I had a barrel here
Whiskey made me pawn me clothes
Whiskey gave me this broken nose
Oh the mate likes whiskey, the skipper likes rum
The sailors like both but me can't get none
Whiskey is the life of man
Whiskey from that old tin can
I thought I heard the first mate say
I treats me crew in a decent way
If whiskey was a river and I could swim
I'd say here goes and dive right in
If whiskey was a river and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom and never come up
I wisht I knew where whiskey grew
I'd eat the leaves and the branches too
A tot of whiskey all around
And a bottle full for the shanty man

Whup Jamboree, whup jamboree
Oh a long-tailed sailor man comin' up behind
Whup Jamboree, whup jamboree
Come an' get your oats me son
The pilot he looked out ahead
The hands on the cane and the heavin' of the lead
And the old man roared to wake the dead
Come and get your oats me son
Oh, now we see the lizzard light
Soon, me boys, we'll heave in sight
We'll soon be abreast of the Isle of Wight
Come and get your oats me son
Now when we get to the black wall dock
Those pretty young girls come out in flocks
With short-legged drawers and long-tailed frocks
Come and get your oats me son
Wel,, then we'll walk down limelight way
And all the girls will spend our pay
We'll not see more 'til another day
Come and get your oats me son

Did you ever see a wild goose
Sailin' o'er the ocean
Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh, heigh
They're just like them pretty girls
When they gets the notion
Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh, heigh
The other mornin'
I was walkin' by the river
When I saw a young girl walkin'
With her topsails all a-quiver
I said pretty fair maid
And how are you this mornin'?
She said None the better
for the seeing of you.
Did you ever see a wild goose
Sailin' o'er the ocean
They're just like them pretty girls
When they gets the notion

Well, a Yankee ship sailed down the river
Blow, boys, blow
Oh, a Yankee ship in the Congo River
Blow, me bully boys, blow
How do you know she's a Yankee clipper?
The Stars and Stripes they fly above her

And who do you think's the skipper of her?
Old Holy Joe the darkie slaver

And what do you think she's got for cargo?
Guns and shot, she runs the embargo

What do you think they'll have for dinner?
Hot water soup, but slightly thinner

Blow today, and blow tomorrow
Blow for all old tars in sorrow
