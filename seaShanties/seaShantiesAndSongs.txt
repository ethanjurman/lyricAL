When the Alabama's keel was laid
Roll Alabama, roll
They laid her keel at Birkenhead
Oh, roll Alabama, roll

Oh, she was built in Birkenhead
Built in the yard of Jonathan Laird

Away down the Mersey she rolled one day
And across the Western she ploughed her way

With British guns, oh, she was stocked
She sailed from Fayal, in Cherbourg she docked

To fight the north Semmes did employ
Any method to kill and destroy

But off Cherbourg the Kearsage lay tight
Awaiting was Winslow to start a good fight

Outside the three mile limit they fought
An Semmes escaped on a fine British yacht

The Kearsage won - Alabama so brave
Sank to the bottom of a watery grave

In the Black Ball line I served my time
To me way-aye-aye, hurray-ah
And that's the line where you can shine
Hurrah for the Black Ball Line
The Black Ball Ships are good and true
They are the ships for me and you
For once there was a Black Ball Ship
That fourteen knots an hour could clip
They'll carry you along through frost and snow
And take you where the wind don't blow
You will surely find a rich gold mine
Just take a trip in the Black Ball Line
Just take a trip to Liverpool
To Liverpool, that Yankee school
The Yankee sailors you'll see there
With red-top boots and short-cut hair
At Liverpool docks we bid adieu
To Poll and Bet and lovely Sue
And now we're bound for New York Town
It's there we'll drink, and sorrow drown

My clothes are all in pawn
Go down you blood red roses, go down
And it's mighty draughty around Cape Horn
Go down you blood red roses, go down
Oh, you pinks and posies
Go down you blood red roses, go down
It's round Cape Horn we've got to go
Chasing whales through ice and snow
Oh my old mother she wrote to me
My darling son come home from sea
Oh it's one more pull and that will do
For we're the bullies to kick her through

Up jumps a crab with his crooked legs
Saying you play the cribbage and I'll stick the pegs
Singing blow the wind westerly, let the wind blow
By a gentle nor'wester how steady she goes
Up jumps a dolphin with his chuckle-head
He jumps on the deck saying pull out the lead!
Up jumps a flounder so flat on the ground
Saying damn your old chocolate, mind how you sound
Up jumps a salmon so bright as the sun
He jumped down between the decks and fired off a gun
Up jumps a whale, the biggest of all
He jumped up aloft and he's pawl after pawl
Up jumps a herring, the king of the sea
He jumps up on deck saying helms a-lee!
Up jumps a shark with his big row of teeth
He jumped up between the decks and shook out the reefs

Come all ye young fellows that follows the sea
To me, way hey, blow the man down
Now please pay attention and listen to me
Give me some time to blow the man down
I'm a deep water sailor just come from Hong Kong
You give me some whiskey, I'll sing you a song
When a trim Black Ball liner's preparing for sea
On a trim Black Ball liner I wasted me prime
When a trim Black Ball liner preparing for sea
You'll split your sides laughing such sights you would see
There's tinkers and tailors, shoemakers and all
They're all shipped for sailors aboard the Black Ball
When a big Black Ball liner's a-leaving her dock
The boys and the girls on the pier-head do flock
Now, when the big liner, she's clear of land
Our bosun he roars out the word of command
Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop
Or I'll help you along with the toe of me boot
Pay attention to orders, now, you one and all
For see high above there flies the Black Ball
'Tis larboard and starboard, on deck you will sprawl
For kicking Jack Rogers commands the Black Ball

Our anchor's aweigh and our sails are all set
Bold Riley, oh, boom-a-lay
The folks we are leaving, we'll never forget
Bold Riley, oh, gone away
Goodbye, me darling. Goodbye, me dear, oh
Bold Riley, oh, boom-a-lay
Goodbye, me darling. Goodbye, me dear, oh
Bold Riley, oh, gone away
Wake up Mary Ellen and don't look so glum
By Whitestocking time you'll be drinking hot rum
The rain it is raining now all the day long
And the northerly wind, it does blow so strong
We're outward and bound for Bengal bay
Get bending, me boys, it's a hell of a way

So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley

I'll leave my gal and go a-whalin'
So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley
So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley

Cape Cod girls ain't got no combs
Haul away, haul away
They brush their hair with codfish bones
And we're bound away for Australia
So heave away, me bully, bully boys
Haul away, haul away
Heave her up and don't you make a noise
And we're bound away for Australia
Cape Cod kids ain't got no sleds
They slide down the hills on codfish heads
Cape Cod girls ain't got no frills
They tie their hair with codfish gills
Cape Cod cats ain't got no tails
They lost them all in the northeast gales

Oh, poor old man your horse will die
And we say so, and we know so
Oh, poor old man your horse will die
Oh, poor old man
We'll hoist him up to the main yardarm
We'll hoist him up to the main yardarm
Say, I old man your horse will die
Say, I old man your horse will die
We'll drop him down to the depths of the sea
We'll drop him down to the bottom of the sea
We'll sing him down with a long, long roll
Where the sharks'll have his body and the devil have have his soul

What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
Early in the morning?
Way-hay, up she rises
Way-hay, up she rises
Way-hay, up she rises
Early in the morning
Put him in the long boat 'til he's sober
Pull out the bung and wet him all over
Put him in the scuppers with the deck pump on him
Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowlin'
Tie him to the taffrail when she's yard-arm under

Essiquibo river is the queen of rivers all

General Taylor gained the day
Walk him along, John, carry him along
General Taylor gained the day
Carry him to his burying ground
To me way hay, you stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
To me way hay, stormy
Carry him to his burying ground
General Taylor died long ago
He's gone, me boys, where the winds never blow
We lowered him down with a silver chain
We made sure he wouldn't rise again
We dug his grave with a silver spade
His shroud of finest silk was made
General Taylor gained the day
General Taylor gained the day

We're going away to leave you now
Good bye, fare thee well
Good bye, fare thee well
We're going away to leave you now
Hoorah, me boys, we're homeward bound
Ah, give me the girl with the bonny brown hair
Your hair of brown is the talk of the town
So fare you we're homeward bound
Homeward bound to Liverpool town
So fill up your glasses for those who were kind
And drink to the girls we leaving behind
We're homeward bound I hear them say
We're homeward bound with eleven months pay
Our anchor we'll weigh, our sails we will set
The friends we are leaving we'll never forget

Louis was the king of France
Before the revolut-i-on
Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe
But then he got his head chopped off
Which spoiled his constitut-i-on
Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe
(To me) way, haul away
We'll heave and hang together
Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe
Once I was in Ireland
Digging turf and pratties
And now I'm on a Yankee ship
Hauling on sheets and braces
Now when I was a little boy
And so me mother told me
That if I didn't kiss the girls
Me lips would all grow mouldy
Way haul away
We'll haul away the bowline
Way, haul away
The packet is a-rollin'

Come get your duds in order
For we're going to leave tomorrow
Heave away, me jollies, heave away
Come get your duds in order
For we're going to cross the water
Heave away me jolly boys, we're all bound away
Sometimes we're bound for Liverpool
Sometimes we're bound for Spain
But now we're bound for St. John's town
To watch the girls a-dancing
Now it's farewell Maggie darling
For it's now I'm going to leave you
You promised me you'd marry me
But how you did deceive me
I wrote me love a letter
And I signed it with a ring
I wrote me love a letter
I was on the Jenny Lind
Sometimes we're bound for Liverpool
Sometimes we're bound for Spain
But now we're bound for St. John's town
To watch the girls a-dancing

Was you ever in Quebec
Bonny laddie, hieland laddie
Stowing timber on the deck
Bonny hieland ladie
Hey ho and away we go
Bonny laddie, hieland laddie
Hey ho and away we go
Bonny hieland ladie
Was you ever in Merashee
Where you stayed fast to tree
Was you ever in Baltimore
Dancin' on that sanded floor
Was you ever in Balville bay
Where the girls are all the go

There were two lofty ships
From old England came
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
One was the Prince of Luther
The other Prince of Wales
All a-cruisin' down the coast
Of High Barbary
Aloft there, aloft there
Our jolly bosun cried
Look ahead, look astern,
Look to weather an' a-lee
There's naught upon the stern, sir
There's naught upon our lee
But there's a lofty ship to wind'ard
An' she's sailin' fast and free
Oh hail her, oh hail her
Our gallant captain cried
Are you a man-o-war
Or a privateer? cried he
Oh, I'm not a man-o-war
Nor privateer, said he
But I am salt sea pirate
All a-looking for me fee
For Broadside, for broadside
A long time we lay
'Til at last the Prince of Luther
Shot the pirate's mast away
Oh quarter, oh quarter
Those pirates they did cry
But the quarter that we gave them
Was we sank 'em in the sea

Go fetch me down me riding cane
For I'm off to see me darlin' Jane
With a hog-eye
Railroad navie with his hog-eye
Roll ashore and a hog-eye, oh
She wants the hog-eye man
Oh, the hog-eye men are all the go
When they come to San Francisco
Now, it's who's been here since I've been gone
Well, a railroad navie with his sea boots on
Oh, Sally in the garden, picking peas
Her golden hair hanging down to her knees
Oh, sally in the garden, shelling peas
With a little hog-eye all sitting on her knees
Well, a hog ship, and a hog-eye crew
Hog-eye mate and a skipper too

From Liverpool docks we bid adieu
To Suke, and Sal, and Kittie too
The anchor's weighed and the sails unfurl
We're bound to cross the watery row
For we know we're outward bound
Hurrah, we're outward bound

The wind it blows from the east nor'east
Our ship will scud ten knots at least
The purser would our wants supply
So while with life we'll never say die
And should we touch at Malabar
Or any other quarters far
Our purser he will tip the chink
And just like fishes we will drink
Then at last our captain comes on board
Our sails are bent, we're manned and stored
The Peter's hoisted at the fore
Good-bye to the girls we'll see no more
For we know we're homeward bound
Hurrah, we're homeward bound
One day the man on the look-out
Proclaims a sail with a joyful shout
Can you make her out? 
I think I can, She's a pilot standing out from the land
And when we're hauled into Liverpool docks
Them bloomers all come 'round in flocks
Them pretty girls, we hear 'em say
Here comes Jack with his twelve-month pay
Next we go to the Dog and Bell
Where there's good vittle there to sell
When in comes Archie with a smile
Drink up me boys, it's worth your while
When poor Jack's money is gone and spent
Nor more to be had, no more to be lent
Then in comes Archie with a frown
Saying Rise up Jack, let John sit down
And so poor Jack must understand
There's ships in the harbour needing hands
So stows his gear like he did before
And says farewell to the Liverpool shore
For he knows he's outward bound
Hurrah, he's outward bound

Well a hundred years on the eastern shore
Oh yes, Oh
Oh, a hundred years on the eastern shore
A Hundred years ago
Well its Bully John from Baltimore
Well I knew him well on the eastern shore
Well it's Bully John's the boy for me
He's a buckle on land and a bully at sea
Well its been a long time and a very long time
Well its been a long time since I made this rhyme
Well my old mother she wrote to me
Me darling son come home from sea
Well I thought I heard the first mate cry
That bleeding top main sheave is dry
Well I thought I heard the old man say
Well it's one more pull and then belay

Our packet is the Island Lass
Lowlands, lowlands, lowlands, low
There's a laddie howlin' at the main topmast
Our skipper comes from Barbados
He's got the name of Hammer Toes
He feeds us bread as hard as brass
Our junk's as salt as a bailer's arse
The monkey wears a sailor's clothes
Now, where he got 'em from, God only knows
It's up aloft that yard must go
Up aloft from down below
We'll haul 'em high and let 'em dry
We'll trice 'em up into the sky
Lowlands, me boys, and up she goes
Get changed, me boys, for your shore-going clothes

John Cherokee was an indian man
Alabama John Cherokee
He run away every time he can
Alabama John Cherokee, way, hey, yah
Alabama John Cherokee, way, hey, yah
Alabama John Cherokee
They put him aboard a Yankee ship
Again he gave the boss the slip
They catch him again and chain him tight
And starve him many a day and night
Nothing to drink and nothin to eat
He just fall dead at the boss's feet
So they bury him by the old gate post
The very same day you can see his ghost

Juliana, Juliana where do you go?
Ah ha, me London Julie
Juliana, Juliana where do you go?
Ah ha, me London Julie
Juliana, Juliana where do you go?
Ah ha, me London Julie
Juliana, Juliana where do you go?
Ah ha, me London Julie
Up aloft, up aloft this spar must go
Up aloft, up aloft from down below
Around Cape Horn there's ice and snow
But around Cape Horn we've got to go
The mate is a-bawlin' down below
So heave away, let's stamp and go

I thought I heard the old man say
John Kanaka-naka too lie ay
Today, today is a holiday
John Kanaka-naka too lie ay
Too lie ay, oh, to lie ay
John Kanaka-naka too lie ay
We'll work tomorrow but no work today
We'll work tomorrow but no work today
We're bound away for 'Frisco Bay
We're bound away at the break of day
We're bound away 'round Cape Horn
We wish to Christ we'd never been born
Oh haul, oh haul, oh haul away
Oh haul away and make your pay
And we are Liverpool born and bred
We're strong in the arm but we're thick in the head

Oh the times was hard and the wages low
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
And the grub was bad and the gales did blow
And it's time for us to leave her
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
For the voyage is done and the winds do blow
And it's time for us to leave her
I thought I heard the Old Man say
You can go ashore and take your pay
Oh her stern was foul and the voyage was long
The winds was bad and the gales was strong
And we'll leave her tight and we'll leave her trim
And heave the hungry packet in
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her with a grin
For there's many a worser we've sailed in
And now it's time to say goodbye
For the old pierhead's a-drawing nigh

When I was young lad I sailed with the rest
On a Liverpool packet bound out to the west
We anchored one day in the harbour of Cork
Then put out to sea for the port of New York
And it's row, row bullies row
Them Liverpool Judies have got us in tow
For 42 days we were hungry and sore
The winds were against us, the gales they did roar
Off Battery Point we did anchor at last
Our jib boom hove in and our canvas all fast
The boardinghouse masters came aboard in a trice
A shouting and a promising all that was nice
Til one fat old crib took a liking to me
Says he you're a fool, lad, to follow the sea
Says he there's a job as is waiting for you
With lashings of liquor and beggar-all to do
Says he what you say lad, will you ? or two
Says I you old bastard, I'm damned if I do
Next I remember I woke in the morn
On a the three skysail yarder bound south round Cape Horn
With an old set of oilskins and two pair of socks
And a blooming great head and a case of the pox
So come all you young sailors take a warning by me
Keep your eye on the drinks when liquor is free
Don't pay no attention to runner or whore
Or your head'll be thick and your throat will be sore

Oh, have you heard the news, me Johnny
One more day
We're homeward bound tomorrow
One more day
Only one more day, me Johnny
One more day
Oh, rock and roll me over
One more day
Don't you hear the old man growlin'
Don't you hear the mate a howlin'
Don't you hear the caps'n pawlin'
Don't you hear the pilot bawlin'
Only one more day a-howlin'
Can't you hear the gals a-callin'
Only one more day a-rollin'
Can't you hear the gulls a-callin'
Only one more day a-furlin'
Only one more day a-cursin'
Oh, heave and sight the anchor, Johnny
For we're close aboard the port, Johnny
Only one more day for Johnny
And your pay-day's nearly due, Johnny
Then put out your long-tail blue, Johnny
Make your port and take your pay, Johnny
Only one more day a-pumpin', Johnny
Only one more day a-bracin'
Oh, we're homeward bound today, Johnny
We'll leave her without sorrow, Johnny
Pack your bags today me Johnny
Oh, an' leave her where she lies, Johnny
Only one more day a-workin', Johnny
Oh, come rock 'n' roll me over
No more gales or heavy weather
Only one more day together

It's a damn tough life full of toil and strife
We whalermen undergo
And we don't give a damn when the gale is done
How hard the winds do blow
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Sound
With a good ship taut and free
And we don't give a damn when we drink our rum
With the girls of Old Maui
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground
Rolling down to Old Maui
Once more we sail with a Northerly gale
Through the ice, and wind, and rain
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands
We soon shall see again
Six hellish months we passed away
On the cold Kamchatka sea
But now we're bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to Old Maui
Once more we sail the Northerly gale
Towards our Island home
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done
And we ain't got far to roam
Our stans'l booms is carried away
What care we for that sound
A living gale after us
Thank God we're homeward bound
How soft the breeze through the island trees
Now the ice is far astern
Them native maids, them tropical glades
Is awaiting our return
Even now their big, brown eyes look out
Hoping some fine to see
Our baggy sails running 'fore the gales
Rolling down to Old Maui
We'll heave the lead where old Diamond Head
Looms up on old Wahu
Our masts and yards are sheathed with ice
And our desks are hid from view
The horrid ice of the sea-caked isles
That deck the Arctic sea
Are miles behind in the frozen wind
Since we steered for Old Maui
And now we're anchoured in the bay
With the Kanakas all around
With chants and soft aloha-oos
They greet us homeward bound
And now ashore we'll have good fun
We'll paint them beaches red
Awakening in the arms of an island maid
With a big fat aching head

Away down south where the cocks do crow
Way down in Florida
The gals they all play the old Banjo
And we'll roll the woodpile down
Rollin', rollin', rollin' the whole world round
That brown gal o' mine's down the Georgia line
And we'll roll the woodpile down
When I was a young man in my prime
I'd clench them yeller girls two at a time
We'll roll 'em high and we'll roll 'em low
We'll heave 'em up and away we'll go
It's rouse and bust 'er is the cry
A black man's wage is never high
Oh, one more heave, and that'll do
For we're the bullies to kick her through

O say was you ever in Rio Grande?
Way, you Rio
It's there that the river runs down golden sand
For we're bound to the Rio Grande
And away, boys, away
Way, you Rio
Sing fare you well my pretty young girls
For we're bound to the Rio Grande
Oh, New York town is no place for me
I'll pack up my bag and go out to sea
So it's pack up your donkey and get under way
The girls we are leaving can take our half pay
We'll sell our salt cod for molasses and rum
And get home again 'fore Thanksgiving has come
Sing good bye to Nellie and good bye to Sue
And you who are listening, good bye to you
And good-bye, fare you well, all you ladies of town
We've left you enough for to buy a silk gown
Now you Bowery ladies we'd have you to know
We're bound to the south'ard, O Lord, let us go!
Our good ship's a-going out over the bar
And we'll point her nose for the South-er-on Star
Oh say was you ever in Rio Grande?
Oh was you ever on that strand?

Well a night on shore wouldn't do us any harm (x3)
And we'll all hang on behind
And we'll roll the old chariot along (x3)
And we'll all hang on behind
Well a nice watch below
Well a nice glass of beer
Well night with the girls
Well a big pot of gold

Oh Sally she'n the gal that I love dearly
Way, sing Sally oh
Sally she'n the gal that I love dearly
Hilo Johnnie Brown stand to your ground
Oh Sally she's the gal that I splice nearly
Her lips is red and her hair is curly
Oh Sally she'n my 'Badian beauty
Sally gal she know her duty
Oh Sally she'n my bright mulatta
Sally gal she do what she ought to
Oh seven long years I courted Sally
But I don't care for her dilly dally
So I signed onboard of a New Bedford whaler
When I come home she was married to a tailor

Santayana fought for Spain
Heave away Santayana
He fought for Spain and he gained his name
All on the plains of Mexico
And it's heave her up and away we'll go
Heave away Santayana
Heave her up and away we'll go
All on the plains of Mexico
Oh Santayana gained the day
And General Taylor he ran away
Oh General Taylor ran away
At Molly del Rey he gained his fame
When I was a young man in my prime
I'd kiss them pretty girls two at a time
But now I'm old and going grey
Oh rum's my sweetheart every day

Oh, I'm going to leave her
Shallow, oh shallow brown
Oh, I'm going to leave her
Shallow brown, shallow brown
Bound away for St. Georges
Bound away for St. Georges
Master's going to sell me
Master's going to sell me
Sell me for the dollar
Great big Spanish dollar
Oh, me clothes is all in order
And me packet leaves tomorrow
Fare thee well my Juliana
Fare thee well my Juliana
Oh, I'm leaving in the morning
Oh, I'm leaving in the morning

Aft on the poopdeck
Walking about
There is the second mate
So sturdy and so stout
What he is thinking of
He only knows himself
Oh, we wish that he would hurry up
And strike, strike the bell
Strike the bell, second mate
Let us go below
Look away to windward
You can see it's going to blow
Look at the glass
You can see that it is fell
We wish the you would hurry up
And strike, strike the bell
Down on the maindeck
Working at the pumps
There is the larboard watch
Ready for their bunks
Over to windward
They see a great swell
They're wishing that the second mate
Would strike, strike the bell
Aft at the wheel
Poor Anderson stands
Grasping the spokes
In his cold, mittened hands
Looking at the compass
The coarse is clear as hell
He's wishing that the second mate
Would strike, strike the bell
For'ad in the fo'c'sle head
Keeping sharp lookout
There is Johnny standing
Ready for to shout
Lights' burning bright, sir
And everything is well
He's wishing that the second mate
Would strike, strike the bell
Aft the quarterdeck
The gallant captain stands
Looking to windward
With his glasses in his hand
What he is thinking of
We know very well
He's thinking more of shortening sail
Than strike, strike the bell

In South Australia I was born
(To me) heave away, haul away
In South Australia round Cape Horn
We're bound for South Australia
Haul away you rolling kings
To me heave away, haul away
Haul away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia
As I walked out one morning fair
'Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair
I shook her up and I shook her down
I shook her round and round the town
I run her all night and I run her all day
And I run her until we sailed away
There ain't but one thing grieves me mind
To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind
And as we wallop around Cape Horn
You'll wish to God you'd never been born
In South Australia my native land
Full of rocks and thieves and fleas and sand
I wish I was on Australia's strand
With a bottle of whiskey in my hand

I wish I was in Mobile Bay, screwing cotton all of the day
But I'm stowing sugar in the hold below,
Below, below, below
Hey, ho, below, below
Stowing sugar in the hold below
Hey, ho, below, below
Stowing sugar in the hold below
The J.M. White, she's a new boat
Stem to stern she's mighty fine
Beat any boat on the New Orleans line
Stowing sugar in the hold below
The engineer shouts through his trumpet
Tell the mate we got bad news.
Can't get steam for the fire in the flue
Stowing sugar in the hold below
The captain's on the quarter deck
Scratchin' 'way at his old neck
And he cries out, Heave the larboard lead
Stowing sugar in the hold below

Tommy's gone on a whaling ship
Away to Hilo
Oh, Tommy's gone on a damn long trip
Tom's gone to Hilo
He never kissed his girl goodbye
He left her and he told her why
She'd robbed him blind and left him broke
He'd had enough, gave her the poke
His half-pay went, it went like chalf
She hung around for the other half
She drank and boozed his pay away
With her weather eye on his next payday
Oh Tommy's gone and left her flat
Oh Tommy's gone and he won't come back

Whiskey-o, Johny-o
Rise her up from down below
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o
Up aloft this yard must go
John rise her up from down below
Now whiskey is the life of man
Always was since the world began
Now whiskey gave me a broken nose
And whiskey made me pawn me clothes
Now whiskey is the life of man
Whiskey from that old tin can
I thought I heard the first mate say
I treats me crew in a decent way
A glass of whiskey all around
And a bottle full for the shanty man

Whiskey is the life of man
Always was since the world began
Whiskey-o, Johnny-o
John rise her up from down below
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey-o
Up aloft this yard must go
John rise her up from down below
Whiskey here, whiskey there
Whiskey almost everywhere
Whiskey up and whiskey down
Whiskey all around the town
Whiskey killed me poor old dad
Whiskey drove me mother mad
My wife and I do not agree
She puts whiskey in her tea
I had a girl and her name was Lize
She puts whiskey in her pies
Oh whiskey straight, and whiskey strong
Give me some whiskey and I'll sing you a song
If whiskey comes too near my nose
I tip it up and down she goes
Some likes whiskey, some likes beer
I wisht I had a barrel here
Whiskey made me pawn me clothes
Whiskey gave me this broken nose
Oh the mate likes whiskey, the skipper likes rum
The sailors like both but me can't get none
Whiskey is the life of man
Whiskey from that old tin can
I thought I heard the first mate say
I treats me crew in a decent way
If whiskey was a river and I could swim
I'd say here goes and dive right in
If whiskey was a river and I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom and never come up
I wisht I knew where whiskey grew
I'd eat the leaves and the branches too
A tot of whiskey all around
And a bottle full for the shanty man

Whup Jamboree, whup jamboree
Oh a long-tailed sailor man comin' up behind
Whup Jamboree, whup jamboree
Come an' get your oats me son
The pilot he looked out ahead
The hands on the cane and the heavin' of the lead
And the old man roared to wake the dead
Come and get your oats me son
Oh, now we see the lizzard light
Soon, me boys, we'll heave in sight
We'll soon be abreast of the Isle of Wight
Come and get your oats me son
Now when we get to the black wall dock
Those pretty young girls come out in flocks
With short-legged drawers and long-tailed frocks
Come and get your oats me son
Wel,, then we'll walk down limelight way
And all the girls will spend our pay
We'll not see more 'til another day
Come and get your oats me son

Did you ever see a wild goose
Sailin' o'er the ocean
Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh, heigh
They're just like them pretty girls
When they gets the notion
Ranzo, Ranzo, weigh, heigh
The other mornin'
I was walkin' by the river
When I saw a young girl walkin'
With her topsails all a-quiver
I said pretty fair maid
And how are you this mornin'?
She said None the better
for the seeing of you.
Did you ever see a wild goose
Sailin' o'er the ocean
They're just like them pretty girls
When they gets the notion

Well, a Yankee ship sailed down the river
Blow, boys, blow
Oh, a Yankee ship in the Congo River
Blow, me bully boys, blow
How do you know she's a Yankee clipper?
The Stars and Stripes they fly above her

And who do you think's the skipper of her?
Old Holy Joe the darkie slaver

And what do you think she's got for cargo?
Guns and shot, she runs the embargo

What do you think they'll have for dinner?
Hot water soup, but slightly thinner

Blow today, and blow tomorrow
Blow for all old tars in sorrow

You bully boys of Liverpool
I'll have you all beware
When you sail on them packet ships,
no dungaree jumpers wear
But have a big monkey jacket
all ready to your hand
For there blows some cold nor'westers
off the banks of Newfoundland
We'll scrape her and we'll scrub her
with holy stone and sand
For there blows some cold nor'westers
on the banks of Newfoundland
We had Jack Lynch from Malnahinch,
Mike Murphy and some more
I tell you well, they suffered like hell
on the way to Baltimore
They pawned there gear in Liverpool
and sailed as they did stand
For there blow some cold nor'westers
on the banks of Newfoundland
Now the mate he stood on the fo'c'sle head
and loudly he did roar
Come rattle her in me lucky lads,
you're bound for America's shore
Come wipe the blood off that dead man's face
and haul or you'll be damned
For there blow some cold nor'westers
on the banks of Newfoundland
So now we're off the hook me boys,
and the land is white with snow
And soon we'll see the pay table
and we'll spend the whole night below
And on the docks, come down in flocks,
those pretty girls will say
Ah, It's snugger with me than on the sea,
on the banks of Newfoundland

Oh the year was 1778
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
A letter of marque came from the king
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
God damn them all
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,
The last of Barrett's Privateers
Oh Elcid Barrett cried the town
For twenty brave men all fishermen who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew
The Antelope sloop was a sickening site
She'd list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
On the King's birthday we put to sea
Ninety-one days to Montego Bay
Pumping like madmen all the way
On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again
When a great big Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight
The Yankee lay low down with gold
She was broad and fat and loose in stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
Then at length she stood two cables away
Our cracked four-pounders made awful din
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the main truck carried off both me legs
Now here I lay in my twenty-third year
It's been six years since we sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday

Oh my name was Robert Kidd
As I sailed, as I sailed
Oh my name was Robert Kidd
As I sailed
My name was Robert Kidd
And God's laws I did forbid
As so wickedly I did
As I sailed, as I sailed
As so wickedly I did
As I sailed
Oh I murdered William Moore
I murdered William Moore
And I laid him in his gore
Not many leagues from shore
I was sick and nigh to death
And I vowed at every breath
For to walk in wisdom's path
My repentance lessened not
My vows I soon forgot
And damnation was my just lot
I spied three ships from Spain
Oh I spied three ships from Spain
I spied three ships from Spain
And I fired on them a-main
And most of them I slain
I spied three ships from France
And to them I did advance
And I took them all by chance
Then fourteen ships I saw
Oh then fourteen ships I saw
Then fourteen ships I saw
And they by my hand did fall
Overtaken now at last
I must die, I must die
And into prison cast
And sentence being past
Come all you young and old
See me die, see me die
Come all you young and old
You are welcome to my goal
And by it I've lost my soul
I must die, I must die
I had ninety bars of gold
As I sailed, as I sailed
And riches uncontrolled
And dollars many-fold
Farewell the raging main
I must die, I must die
Oh farewell the raging main
Farewell the raging main
To Turkey, France, and Spain
I never shall see it again
For I must die, I must die

I'm the man before the mast
That ploughs the raging sea
And on this simple subject
Will you please enlighten me
Common sailors we are called
Come tell me the reason why
And on this simple subject I'll reply
Don't you call us common sailors anymore
Don't you call us common sailors anymore
Good things to you we bring
Don't you call us common men
We're as good as anybody that's on shore
The young girls of this country
Their growing days we bless
We brings them silks and satins
Out of which they makes a dress
To gain the heart of some young man
As fancy dresses do
Don't never despise the sailor boys
That sails the ocean blue
The young gents of this country
They're sitting at their ease
Not thinking on the stormy nights
That we spent on the seas
We brings the leaves to make cigars
To decorate their face
They wouldn't call us common
If they were sometimes in our place
When speaking of a man ashore
We never hear you say
He's a common this or common that
Be his calling what it may
Be he a travelling tinker,
Or a scavanger, or a sweep
Then why call us common sailors
Who battle with the deep

On the 5th of November back in '53
The big man at Dolphin, sure, he sent for me
We brought you here, sonny, 'cause we want you to know
We've booked you a berth in water below
With the diesel and shale, diesel and shale
We've booked you a berth with the diesel and shale
But when I protested, I'm no volunteer
They said we ain't had one in many's a year
But that's a wee secret between you and me
There's many a pressed man down under the sea
With the diesel and shale, diesel and shale
Down under the sea with the diesel and shale
Oh doctor, oh doctor, I don't think I'm well
Well, never mind, sonny, we'll very soon tell
Try holding your breath 'til I counts up to three
There! That proves you're fit to go under the sea
With the diesel and shale, diesel and shale
To go under the sea with the diesel and shale
I went to the storeroom to gather me rig
They gave me a sweater ten sizes too big
I climbed down that boat like an old polar bear
I says to meself there's a smell in the air
And it's diesel and shale, diesel and shale
There's a smell in the air and it's diesel and shale
A blast on the klaxon, ring on the gong
And then you go down where no mortal belongs
Where the air's goin' bad, the bread's goin' stale
They mix you a nightcap of diesel and shale
Diesel and shale, diesel and shale
They mix you a nightcap of diesel and shale
We circled the Med for a summer or two
Where the water's so warm and the sky is so blue
'Least that's what they tell me, but I wouldn't know
You don't see much sun when you're stuck down below
With the diesel and shale, diesel and shale
When you're stuck down below with the diesel and shale
Oh Susie, oh Susie, won't you be mine?
Submariners' wives have a hell of a time
You'll live like a duchess with cash on the nail
If you don't mind the smell of the diesel and shale
Diesel and shale, diesel and shale
If you don't mind the smell of the diesel and shale
Then the big man at Dolphin, 'e told me at last
It's time you went back to your ship with a mast
I'll feel just like Jonah, leaving his whale
But you know where to stick all your diesel and shale
Diesel and shale, diesel and shale
You know where to stick all your diesel and shale

Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack
Safe and sound at home again
Let the waters roar, Jack

Long we've tossed on the rolling main
Now we're safe ashore, Jack
Don't forget your old shipmate
Fal dee ral dee ral dee rye eye doe!

Since we sailed from Plymouth Sound
Four years gone, or nigh, Jack
Was there ever chummies, now
Such as you and I, Jack?

We have worked the self-same gun:
Quarterdeck division
Sponger I and loader you
Through the whole commission

Oftentimes have we laid out
toil nor danger fearing,
Tugging out the flapping sail
to the weather bearing
When the middle watch was on
And the time went slow, boy
Who could choose a rousing stave
Who like Jack or Joe, boy?

There she swings, an empty hulk
Not a soul below now
Number seven starboard mess
Misses Jack and Joe now

But the best of friends must part
Fair or foul the weather
Hand yer flipper for a shake
Now a drink together

Don't mind the rain or the rolling sea
The weary night never worries me
But the hardest time in a sailor's day
Is to watch the sun as it dies away
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line
The finest ship that sails the sea
Is still a prison for the likes of me
But give me wings like Noah's dove
I'll fly up harbour to the girl I love
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line
Oh once my heart was wild and free
Like a flashing spar on the open sea
But now that spar has washed ashore
And come to rest at my true love's door
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line
Each time I gaze behind the screws
Makes me long for Saint Peter's shoes
I'd dance on down that Walker Shore
And rest in my true love's arms once more
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line
Oh Lord if dreams were only real
I'd feel my hands on that wooden wheel
And with all my heart I'd turn her round
And tell the boys that we're homeward bound
Here's one more day on the Grey Funnel Line
I'll pass the time like some machine
Until the waters turn to green
Then I'll dance on down that walk ashore
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more

Remember, yes, I remember well
The most famous rum-runner of them all,
Remember, yes, I remember well
The most famous rum-runner of them all
She was the schooner from Lunenburg, I'm Alone
And in the Gulf of Mexico she went down
Under fire from a Yankee cutter
On the high seas, outside treaty water
Oh, I'm Alone
A long way from Lunenburg she went down
Because skipper John Randell wouldn't heave-to
On the I'm Alone
It was nineteen hundred and twenty-nine
When the smuggling of liquor was a profitable pastime.
Many a Maritimer didn't see why
He shouldn't turn a profit - Uncle Sam was dry
Many a family took on style
Because Prohibition made it very worthwhile
To be a good Samaritan
To long-sufferin', thirsty Americans
The schooner's captain was a wild Newfoundlander,
A hard-drivin' man, name of John Thomas Randell.
A decorated veteran of the First World War
And a sea-goin' gentleman adventurer.
From Belize he would take the I'm Alone
Towards the coast of Louisiana
And he'd anchor south of Trinity Shoal
Where he'd meet his man
And discharge the cargo according to plan
It was all clear sailing for the I'm Alone
With the profits from six or seven trips salted down.
The coast guard had bothered her a couple of times,
But skipper John's seamanship had left 'em behind.
One March morning, in the wind and the swell,
She was reachin' along under jumbo, jib and storm trysail
When the cutter Dexter
Swept in on the I'm Alone's starboard quarter
Now the Dexter's captain was a very rough man;
He had sworn that he'd never lose the I'm Alone again.
He ran a string of signals, saying: How do you do?
Now you know that I'll fire if you don't heave-to!
Skipper John semaphored immediately:
I'm on the high seas and you have no jurisdiction over me.
So the Dexter's captain
Sent several volleys through the I'm Alone's riggin'
The bullets tore the booms and the sails and the lines -
They even tore a hole in the Red Ensign.
When skipper John saw it, he was fit to be tied
At the disrespect shown to his national pride.
The crew said, Sir, don't you trouble your mind;
We'll all go down together with the old Red Ensign a-flyin'!
So he signaled to the Dexter:
Shoot and be damned to you, for I'll not surrender!
Well the Dexter opened fire; it didn't take long
When her guns stitched a seam along the I'm Alone's waterline.
Skipper John ordered every man to sea -
There was water on the bridge when he himself jumped free.
Stern in the air, the I'm Alone went down:
Such a heavy sea a-runnin'
It's a wonder only one man was drowned -
The bo'sun was the one
Who was pulled aboard the cutter when his life was gone
And that's how it happened; there isn't much more.
The I'm Alone became an international affair.
Skipper John and his seamen were all released
Because the U.S. government couldn't make a case.
That kind of violence is bound to happen
When a law like Prohibition sits up and begs to be broken.
And we still recall
The story of the I'm Alone and skipper John Randell

Well me father often told me when I was just a lad
A sailor's life was very hard, the food was always bad
But now I've joined the navy, I'm aboard a man-o-war
And now I've found a sailor ain't a sailor any more
Don't haul on the rope, don't climb up the mast
If you see a sailing ship it might be your last
Just get your civies ready for another run ashore
A sailor ain't a sailor, ain't a sailor anymore
Well the killock of our mess he says we've had it soft
It wasn't like this in his day when he was up aloft
We like our bunks and sleeping bags, but what's a hammock for?
Swinging from the deckhead, or lying on the floor?
Well they gave us an engine that first went up and down
Then with more technology the engine went around
We know our steam and diesel but what's a mainyard for?
A stoker ain't a stoker with a shovel anymore.
Well they gave us Aldiss lamp so we could do it right
They gave us a radio, we signaled day and night
We know our codes and cyphers but what's a semaphore?
A bunting-tosser doesn't toss the bunting anymore
Two cans of beer a day and that's your bleeding lot
Now we get an extra one because they've stopped the tot
So we'll put on our civie clothes and find a pub ashore
A sailor's still a sailor just like he was before

I'm marchin' inland from the shore
Over me shoulder I'm carryin' an oar
When someone asks me What is that funny thing you've got?
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more, no more
Then I know I'll never go to sea no more
Lord Nelson knew the perfect way to cure your mal-de-mere
And if you pay attention, his secret I will share
To any sea-sick sailor he'd give this advice for free
If you're feeling sea-sick, sit underneath a tree
Columbus he set sail to find out if the world was round
He kept on sailing west until he ran aground
He thought he'd found the Indies, but he found the U.S.A.
I know some navigators who can still do that today
Drake is in his hammock, and a thousand miles away
Grenville's Revenge is at the bottom of the bay
Manys the famous sailor never came home from the sea
Just take my advice, Jack, come and follow me
So, sailor take a warnin' from these men of high renown
When you leave the ocean and it's time to settle down
Never cast your anchor less than ninety miles from shore
There'll always be temptation to be off to sea once more

I dreamed a dream the other night
Lowlands, lowlands away my John
I dreamed a dream the other night
Lowlands, my lowlands away
I dreamed I saw my own true love
He stood so still, he did not move
So dank his hair, so dim his eye
I knew he'd come to say goodbye
I'm drowned in the lowland sea, he said.
Oh you and I will ne'er be wed.
I'll never kiss you more, he said
Ne'er kiss you more, for I am dead.
I will cut off my bonny hair
No other man will find me fair
I dreamed a dream the other night
I dreamed a dream the other night

When I was a lad in a fishing town
My old man said to me:
You can spend your life, your jolly life
Sailing on the sea.
You can search the world for pretty girls
Til your eyes grow weak and dim,
But don't go fishing for a mermaid, son
If you don't know how to swim
'Cause her hair was green as seaweed
Her skin was blue and pale
I loved that girl with all my heart
I only liked the upper part
I did not like the tail
So I signed aboard of a whaling ship
And my first very day at sea
There I spied in the waves,
Reaching out for me
Come live with me in the sea said she,
Down on the ocean floor
And I'll show you many's a wonderous thing
That you've never seen before
So over I jumped and she pulled me down,
Down to her seaweed bed
A pillow made of tortoise-shell
She placed beneath my head
She fed me shrimp and caviar
Upon a silver dish
From her head to her waist was just to my taste
But the rest of her was a fish
'Cause ...
Then one day, she swam away
So I sang to the clams and the whales
Oh, how I miss her seagreen hair
And the silvery shine of her scales
Then her sister, she swam by
And set my heart awhirl
From her head to her waste was an ugly fish
But the rest of her was a girl
'Cause her hair was green as seaweed
Her skin was blue and pale
I loved that girl with all my heart
I did not like the upper part
And that's how I get my ...

It was a Friday morn when we set sail
And we were not far from the land
When our captain, he spied a fishy mermaid
With a comb and a glass in her hand
Oh the ocean waves do roll
And the stormy winds do blow
And we poor sailors are skipping at the top
While the landlubbers lie down below, below, below
While the landlubbers lie down below
Up spoke the captain of our gallant ship
And a brave old skipper was he
This fishy mermaid has warned me of our doom
We shall sink to the bottom of the sea
Up spoke the first mate of our gallant ship
And a well-spoken man was he
I have me a wife in Salem by the sea
And tonight she a widow will be
Up spoke the bosun of our gallant ship
And a brave young man was he
Well I've got a sweetheart at St. John's by the sea
And tonight she be weepin' for me
Up spoke the cook of our gallant ship
And a greasy old butcher was he
I care much more for my pots and my pans
Than I do for the bottom of the sea
Then up spoke the cabinboy, of our gallant ship
And a nasty little lad was he
I'm not quite sure I can spell mermaid
But I'm going to the bottom of the sea
Then three times around spun our gallant ship
And three times around spun she
Three times around spun our gallant ship
And she sank to the bottom of the sea

Hail ya ho boys, let her go boys
Bring her head 'round, and all together
Hail ya ho boys, let her go boys
Sailing homeward to Mingalay
What care we how wild the minch is
What care we for windy weather
Hail ya ho boys, every inch is
Sailing closer to Mingalay
Wives and sweethearts on the hillside
Looking seaward through the heather
Let her go boys, and we'll anchor
'Ere the sun sets on Mingalay
When the wind is wild with shouting
And the waves mount ever higher
Anxious eyes turn ever seaward
To see us home, boys, to Mingalay

On the fifteenth day of February
Nineteen-Eighty-Two
The Ocean Ranger was capsized
And lost all of its crew
84 precious lives were lost
On that sad and fateful day
Some were Newfoundlanders
And some were C.F.A.
The crew in desperation tried
To launch their covered boats
When they saw the rig, the Ranger
Would no longer stay afloat
But the seas were far too treacherous
And the waves were far too high
And each man knew that hope was gone
It was his time to die
And what an awful night it was
Out on those roaring seas
The Russian trawler went down too
Just sixteen miles east
And thirty Russian lives were lost
And they were just as dear
As those we lost from Newfoundland
And memories we rever
Like their sons who follow after
And their fathers gone before
Our men must earn their living
On that wild and treacherous shore
And whether they're hunting fish
Or seals, whales, or crude oil
They must endure and persevere
In hardship and in toil
And now the wakes are over
And the masses have been said
And the widows and the orphans
Now are left to mourn their dead
We pray to God the father
And the son, and holy ghost
To protect all those who venture forth
Off Newfoundland's fateful coast

Call all hands to man the capstan
See the cable run down clear
Heave away and with a will boys
For old England we will steer
And we'll sing in joyful chorus
In the watches of the night
And we'll sight the shores of England
When the grey dawn brings the light
Rolling home, rolling home, rolling home across the sea
Rolling home to dear old England
Rolling home, dear land to thee
Up aloft amid the rigging
Blows the loud exulting gale
Like a bird's wide out-streached pinions
Spreads on high each swelling sail
And the wild waves cleft behind us
Seem to murmur as they flow
There are loving hearts that wait you
In the land to which you go
Many thousand miles behind us
Many thousand miles before
Ancient ocean have to waft us
To the well-remembered shore
Cheer up Jack, bright smiles await you
From the fairest of the fair
And her loving eyes will greet you
With kind welcomes everywhere

I've got a halibut boat, the openin' is over
The fish just weren't biting, our catch is way down
We're salvagers now, there's logs that are waiting
We pull them off shore and sell them in town, and we'll
Snap the line tight, haul them away
Snap the line tight, she's rockin', she's free
Snap the line tight, haul them away
Slide them off into the sea
She's a six-foot thick hemlock half-sunken in sand
Gotta dig out a hole for to pass the line through
Wrap her around and when she's tied and ready
Then stand clear away while you signal the crew to
And it's thirty-six hours we've been without sleep
Got to boom them by dawn if we're makin' this tide
It's a five hour haul, with a nor'wester blowin'
And a starboard-side swell for a bloody rough ride, so
And our back-decks a mess of anchours and peavies,
All slidin' and tangled in cables and chain
We're in the middle with pike poles and chokers
To wrap the logs tight so they're not lost again, and we
How many thousands of acres of forest
Lie scattered and heaped by the wind and the tide?
The companies cut them and boomed them and lost them,
Then left them to rot where they lie, but we

Farewell and adieu unto you Spanish ladies
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain
For it's we've received orders for to sail for old England
But we hope very soon we shall see you again
We'll rant and we'll roar like true British sailors
We'll rant and we'll roar across the salt seas
Until we strike soundings in the Channel of Old England
From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues
We hove our ship to with the wind at sou'west, boys
We hove our ship to, our soundings to see
So we rounded and sounded; got forty-five fathoms
We squared our main yard and up channel steered we
Now the first land we made it is called the Deadman
Next Ram Head off Plymouth, off Portland the Wight
We sailed by Beachy, by Fairlee and Dungeness
Till we came abreast of the South Foreland Light
Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor
All in the Downs that night for to lie
Then it's stand by your stoppers, see clear your shank-painters,
Haul all your clew garnets, let tacks and sheets fly
Now let every man toss off a full bumper
And let every man drink off a full glass
And we'll drink and be merry and drown melancholy
Singing, here's a good health to each true-hearted lass

As I roved out on a fine summer's evening
To view these flowers and take the air
'Twas there I spied a tender mother
Speaking with her daughter dear
Saying, Daughter, oh daughter, I'll have you to marry
No longer to live the sweet single life.
Mother, oh mother, I'd rather to tarry
And be some brave young sailor's wife.
A sailor shy, he sits for to wander.
To some foreign country he go.
They will cause you to sigh and to murmur,
They will prove your overthrow.
Oh, would you have me to marry a farmer,
To be your joy and heart's delight.
But give me the lad with the tarry, tarry, trousers
To shine in my eyes like the diamond bright.
She hung her head on the top of her shoulders.
Tears from her eyes like fountains flowed.
I'll stay at home and be true hearted
While my love to the sea doth go.
Hark, oh hark, how the great guns rattle,
Big and small, they all make noise.
My true love's in the field of battle.
Now fight on, my gallant boys.

I am a sailor both brisk and bold
And a long time have I sailed the ocean
And if you want to know my name
My name it is Jack Johnson
Shipmates I'll bid you adieu
No more to sea will I go along with you
But to ramble this country through and through
And I'll be a ramblin' sailor
When I was a walking out one day
Down by the London River
A pretty little fair maid I chanced to spy
Now we walked along together
Her lips were like two roses red
A fine feather bonnet was covering her head
So I took the harboard on her, she said she was a maid
That saucy little trim-rigged doxy
I shan't and I can't go along with you
You saucy ramblin' sailor
My parents now they would not agree
And I'm promised to a tailor
But I was all too eager to sample all her charms
A dearest guinea to roll in your arms
Well the deal was done, up stairs we went
That's me and the trim-rigged doxy
Well it's all on the bone and let your stays'ls fall
We was yard after yard a boppin'
Me shot-locker empty, it's asleep I fall
Was then that she took to robbin'
She emptied all me pockets of all that I had
She even took the boots from the end of the bed
She even took the gold watch from underneath me head
`That saucy little trim-rigged doxy
Next mornin' bright I awoke
And I started to roar like thunder
For all of me money now, me gold watch too
She'd bore them away for plunder
'Twas not for me money, nor me gold watch too
For these had value, but to tell you true
To think a little fireball could burn me boxty through
That saucy little trim-rigged doxy
To think a little fireball could burn me boxty through
That saucy little trim-rigged doxy

Love is the traitor of a sailor's life
He cause the girls to loose their hearts' delight
He cause them to sigh, he cause them to mourn
All for my true love, never to return
Father, father, build me a boat
Out on the ocean I will float
There I'll hail each ship as I pass by
There I'll enquire for my true sailor boy
She went a-sailin' on down the main
She met three ships just out from Spain
There she hailed each ship as she passed by
There she enquired for her true sailor boy
Captain, captain, tell me true
Do my sweet William sail with you
Oh, no fair maid he don't sail here
He's drownded in the Gulf my dear
She ran her boat up against a rock
Thought to all her soul she'd broke her heart
She wrang her hands and tore her hair
Just like some lady in despair
She called for a chair to sit her down
Pen and ink she wrote it down
Oh, the end of every line she dropped a tear
End of every verse was Oh, my dear
Father, father, dig my grave
Place a marble stone at my head and feet
Upon my breast a turkle dove
To show to the world that I died for love

Me name's Able Rogers, a shareman am I
On a three-masted schooner from Twillingate Isle
I've been the world over, north, south, east, and west
But the middle of nowhere's where I like it best
Where it's wave over wave, sea over bow
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow
There's no other life for a sailor like me
But to sail the salt sea, boys, sail the sea
There's no other life but to sail the salt sea
The work it is hard and the hours are long
My spirit is willing, my back it is strong
And when the work's over then whiskey we'll pour
We'll dance with the girls upon some foreign shore
I'd leave my wife lonely ten months of the year
She made me a home and raised my children dear
But she'd never come out to bid farewell to me
Or ken why a sailor must sail the salt sea
I've sailed the wide oceans four decades or more
And ofttimes I've wondered what I do it for
I don't know the answer, it's pleasure and pain
With life to live over, I'd do it again

From Port Hardy one morning I cast off my line
The sea was all smooth, the weather just fine
Out for Castle Rock, I was headed away
To where the Coho flash silver all over the bay
Where the Coho flash silver all over the bay
It was just before dawn when I reached the fish ground
So I lowered my poles and I let my lines down
I lit up my pipe and I waited and pray
To see the Coho flash silver all over the bay
See the Coho flash silver all over the bay
Well the sun came up shining and so did the fish
Them girdies were humming, what more could I wish
Them bells were all ringing, I was making it pay
Where the Coho flash silver all over the bay (x2)
Well they bit all that morning 'til just after noon
They were so hungry they'd strike at an old leather shoe
This must be heaven, to myself I did say
Where the Coho flash silver all over the bay (x2)
When I got home that evening they asked How did you do?
And I showed them silver darlings two-hundred and two
Well Tom you're high liner, you're the best here today.
Where the Coho flash silver all over the bay (x2)
Well there's your doctors and lawyers and bankers and more
Your wheelers and dealers with the big deals galore
But let me be a troller and king for a day
Where the Coho flash silver all over the bay (x2)

I signed aboard this whaling ship
I made my mark it's true
And I'll serve out the span of time
I swore that I would do
But I'll not man your boats again
Though you cast me in the sea
For I tell you sir, them fish can think
As well as you or me
Just yesterday the lookout's call
Had bent us to our work
I took me place like all the rest
I'd not be one to shirk
Now thirteen men's been drownded
And no more of them we'll see
I'd take an oath, them fish can think
As well as you or me
We'd pulled our boats abreast the pod
The steersman took his stand
He'd had no time to make his throw
When the oar flew from my hand
Just then a great fluke smashed our boat
The whale I didn't see
Now I believe them fish can think
As well as you or me
For then them whales destroyed our boats
They rammed them one by one
They stove them all with head and fluke
And after they was done
We few poor souls left half-alive
Was clinging to debris
I'd stake me life them fish can think
As good as you and me
The way them whale fish went for us
It seemed as though t'was planned
For each one had his target boat
They played us man for man
Just knowin' now they think so clear
My heart says let them be
I swear to God them fish can think
As good as you or me
Now John is blind, Jim's lost an arm
And Caleb's lost below
My leg will heal but other men
No more aloft can go
So I'll not man your boats again
Though you drown me in the sea
For I tell you sir, them fish can think
As good as you or me

Willy Taylor brisk young sailor
Full of fun and full of glee
Up to church they went together
Dressed in silk so rich and gay
Oh the vows, oh the breezes
Vows and breezes fade away
Birds were singing, bells were ringing
Up to church they went with glee
In marched four and twenty sailors
Pressed young Willy off to sea
Now she's shipped onboard a vessel
In the name of Richard IV
Her once white and delicate fingers
Now they're covered with pitch and tar
Now she's on the yardarm reefing
Doing her duty like all the rest
When her waistcoat it blew open
And there she shows her lily-white breast
When the Captain came to hear it
Saying Fair maid what brings you here?
I'm in search of my true lover,
Who was pressed from me so dear.
If you're in search of your true lover
Tell me what his name might be
His name it is young Willy Taylor
Seven long years he's been gone from me
If you rise early tomorrow morning
Just before the break of day
It's there you'll see your Willy Taylor
Walking with some lady gay
So she rose early the next morning
Just before the break of day
And there she saw young Willy Taylor
Walking out with his lady gay
Now she's called for a pistol
Which was given at her command
And she shot her Willy Taylor
Standing by his bride's right hand
When the Captain came to hear it
Saying Young maid what have you done?
And he's made her his first lieutentant
On his ship of 900 ton
Now she's on the quarterdeck walking
Sword and pistol in her hand
And every time that she gives orders
Sailors tremble at her command

Down from the Carolina shore
The Yankee sails tonight
Carrying soldiers, guns and more
Down below, the Yankee sails tonight
The order's in and the trading's done
The Yankee sails tonight
To put an end to the revolut-i-on
Down below, the Yankee sails tonight
Oh, she blows with the wind
It's a bloody end
That she has for the rebels' fight
When there's money in the banks
There's hoodlums in the ranks
Down below, down below, the Yankee sails tonight
The Yankee once was a ship so bold
She sailed for freedom not for gold
But tyrants stole away the ship
Now she robs from the poor for the greedy rich
Where do your hard-earned taxes go?
Down below the borders of Mexico
And where are the tyrants' orders from?
From Wall Street and from Washington
Do you think it's for democracy
When they practice common butchery
So sing a song for the FSLN
And bring the Yankee home again
Back in the land of liberty
That's where you'd like your home to be
But where did you get your freedom from?
You fought your own revolut-i-on

Ye mariners all, as ye pass by
Come in and drink if you are dry
Come spend, me lads, your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this
Oh mariners all, if you've half a crown
You're welcome all for to sit down
Come spend, me lads, your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this
Oh tipplers all, as you pass by
Come in and drink if you are dry
Come in and drink, think not amis
And pop your nose in a jug of this
Oh now I'm old and can scarcely crawl
I've a long grey beard and a head that's bald
Crown my desire, fulfill my bliss
A pretty girl and a jug of this
And when I'm in my grave and dead
And all my sorrows are past and fled
Transform me then into a fish
And let me swim in a jug of this

In Placentia Bay there sat on the shore
A young girl who mourned for her love who's no more
The pride of his manhood is the prize of the sea
And the seagulls still follow on freedom
She reached out her hand to an old man passed by
And she lifted her head with a tear in her eye
Said, Sit and I'll tell you a tale of some woe
While the seagulls still follow on freedom
I come from Toronto, upon the mainland
And there's many's a thing here that I don't understand
Like why are these young men still slaves to the sea
When the seagulls still follow on freedom
He said to this young maid, as held her small hand
The sea and its fury are part of this land
And them who can't take it had better not stay
With the seagulls who follow on freedom
Those men who quote figures and count the cause lost
They see on the high seas and the lives it has cost
They don't see the life as we know it to be
Like the seagulls who follow on freedom
So they cheat us and they rob us and continue to say
That our only salvation is leaving the bay
But I'll soon be ninety and there's one thing I know
That the seagulls still follow on freedom

With our nets and gear we're faring
On the wild and wasteful ocean
It's there on the deep that we harvest and reap our bread
As we hunt the bonny shoals of herring
Oh, it was a fine and a pleasant day
Out of Yarmouth harbour I was faring
As a cabin boy on a sailing lugger
For to go and hunt the shoals of herring
Now the work was hard and the hours were long
And the treatment sure it took some bearing
There was little kindness and the kicks were many
As we hunted for the shoals of herring
Oh, we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank
I was cook and I'd a quarter's sharing
And I used to sleep standing on me feet
And I'd dream about the shoals of herring
Well, we left the home grounds in the month of June
And to canny Shiels we soon was bearing
With a hundred cran of the silver darlings
That we'ed taken from the shoals of herring
Now you're up on deck, you're a fisherman
You can swear and show a manly bearing
Take you turn on watch with the other fellows
While you're following the shoals of herring
In the stormy seas and the living gale
Just to earn your daily bread you're daring
From the Dover Straits to the Faroe Islands
While you're following the shoals of herring
Well, I earned me cape and I paid me way
And I earned the gear that I was wearing
Sailed a million miles, caught ten million fishes
We was following the shoals of herring
